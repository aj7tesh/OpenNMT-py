Outcomes of Democracy Overview As we begin to wind up our tour of democracy, it is time to move beyond our discussion of specific themes and ask a general set of questions: What does democracy do? Or, what outcomes can we reasonably expect of democracy?
Also, does democracy fulfil these expectations in real life?
We begin by thinking about how to assess the outcomes of democracy.
After some clarity on how to think on this subject, we proceed to look at the expected and actual outcomes of democracy in various respects: quality of government, economic well-being, inequality, social differences and conflict and finally freedom and dignity.
Our final verdict - positive but qualified - leads us to think about the challenges to democracy in the next and final chapter.
Democracy remains democracy only as long as every citizen has a chance of being in majority at some point of time.
from being in majority on the basis of birth, then the democratic rule ceases to be accommodative for that person ot group.
Greeting Dignity and freedom of the citizens Democracy stands much superior to any other form of government in promoting dignity and freedom of the individual.
Every individual wants to receive respect from fellow beings.
Often conflicts arise among individuals because some feel that they are not treated with due respect.
The passion for respect and freedom are the basis of democracy.
Democracies throughout the world have recognised this, at least in principle.
This has been achieved in various degrees in various democracies.
For societies which have been built for long on the basis of subordination and domination, it is not a simple matter to recognize that all individuals are equal.
Take the case of dignity of women.
When we find such significant difference in the rates of economic growth between countries under dictatorship and democracy, it is better to prefer democracy as it has several other positive outcomes.
Reduction of inequality and poverty Perhaps more than development, it is reasonable to expect democracies to reduce economic disparities.
Even when a country achieves economic growth, will wealth be distributed in such a way that all citizens of the country will have a share and lead a better life?
Is economic growth in democracies accompanied by increased inequalities among the people?
Or do democracies lead to a just distribution of goods and opportunities?
Voice of the Poor Democracies are based on political equality.
All individuals have equal weight in electing representatives.
Parallel to the ptocess of bringing individuals into the political arena on an equal footing, we find growing economic inequalities.
A small number of ultra-rich enjoy a highly disproportionate share of wealth and incomes.
Not only that, their share in the total income of the country has been increasing.
Those at the bottom of the society have very little to depend upon.
Their incomes have been declining, Sometimes they find it difficult to meet their basic needs of life, such as food, clothing, house, education and health.
In actual life, democracies do not appear to be very successful in reducing economic inequalities.
In Class [X Economics textbook, you have already studied about poverty in India.
The poor constitute a large proportion of our voters and no party will like to lose their votes.
Yet democratically elected governments do not appear to be as keen to address the question of poverty as you would expect them to.
The situation is much worse in some other countries.
In Bangladesh, more than half of its population lives in poverty.
People in several poor countries are now dependent on the rich countties even for food supplies.
con The Manila Times © Manny Francisco - The Phillippines, Cagle Cartoons Inc. Accommodation of social diversity Do democracies lead to peaceful and harmonious life among citizens?
It will be a fair expectation that democracy should produce a harmonious social life.
We have seen in the earlier chapters how democracies accommodate various social divisions.
We saw in the first chapter how Belgium has successfully negotiated differences among ethnic populations.
Democracies usually develop a procedure to conduct their competition.
This reduces the possibility of these tensions becoming explosive or violent.
No society can fully and permanently resolve conflicts among different groups. But we can certainly learn to respect these differences and we can also evolve mechanisms to negotiate the differences.
Democracy is best suited to produce this outcome.
Non-democratic regimes often turn a blind eye to or suppress internal social differences.
Ability to handle social differences, divisions and conflicts is thus a definite plus point of democratic regimes. But the example of Sri Lanka reminds us that a democracy must fulfil two conditions in order to achieve this outcome: @ It is necessary to understand that democracy is not simply rule by majority opinion.
The majority always needs to work with the minority so that governments function to represent the general view.
Majority and minority opinions are not permanent.
@ It is also necessary that rule by majority does not become rule by majority community in terms of religion or race or linguistic group, etc.
Rule by majority means that in case of every decision or in case of every election, different persons and groups may and © Pat Bagley - Cagle Cartoons Inc. aj Gis og © Pers Tepe Tes equal treatment of women are necessary ingredients of a democratic society.
This is how it should be, for democracy appeals to some of our deep values.
These debates cannot be resolved ina simple manner.
But some debates about democracy can and should be resolved by referring to some facts and figures.
The debate about the economic outcomes of democracy is one such debate.
Over the years many students of democracy have gathered careful evidence to see what the relationship of democracy ० ॥+ह७)).85 with economic growth and economic .
The tables and the cartoon here present some of the evidences: © Jimmy Margulies - Cagle Cartoons Inc. e@ Table 1 shows that on an average dictatorial regimes have had a slightly better record of economic growth.
But when we compare their record only in poor countries, there is virtually no difference.
@ Table 2 shows that within democracies there can be very high degree of inequalities.
In democratic countries like South Africa and Brazil, the top 20 per cent people take away more than 60 per cent of the national income, leaving less than 3 per cent for the bottom 20 per cent population.
Countries like Denmark and Hungary are much better in this respect.
@ You can see in the cartoon, there is often inequality of opportunities available to the poorer sections.

Democracy and Diversity Overview wT om) In the last chapter, we saw how power can be distributed to C accommodate linguistic and regional diversities.
But language and region are not the only features that give a distinct identity to people.
Sometimes, people also identify themselves and relate with others on the basis of their physical appearance, class, religion, gender, caste, tribe, etc.
In this chapter, we study how democracy responds to social differences, divisions and inequalities.
We begin with an example of public expression of social divisions.
We then draw some general lessons about how social differences can take various forms.
We then turn to how democratic politics affects and is affected by these social diversities.
Some of the differences are based on our choices.
It is also possible for people from different religions to have the same caste and feel close to each other.
As we saw in the examples of Belgium and Sri Lanka, if the rulers are willing to share power and accommodate the reasonable demands of minority community, social divisions become less threatening for the country.
But if they try to suppress such a demand in the name of national unity, the end result is often quite the opposite.
Such attempts at forced integration often sow the seeds of disintegration.
Thus the assertion of social diversities in a country need not be seen as a source of danger.
In a democracy, political expression of social divisions is very normal and can be healthy.
This allows various disadvantaged and marginal social groups to express their grievances and get the government to attend to these.
Expression of various kinds of social divisions in politics often results in their cancelling one another out and thus reducing their © Dario Castillejos - Cagle Cartoons Inc. intensity.
This leads to strengthening of a democracy.
But a positive attitude towards diversity and a willingness to accommodate it do not come about easily.
People who feel marginalised, deprived and discriminated have to fight against the injustices.
Such a fight often takes the democratic path, voicing their demands in a peaceful and constitutional manner and seeking a fair position through elections.
Sometimes social differences can take the form of unacceptable level of social inequality and injustice.
The struggle against such inequalities sometimes takes the path of violence and defiance of state power.
However history shows that democracy is the best way to fight for recognition and also to accommodate diversity.
1. Discuss three factors that determine the outcomes of politics of social divisions.
When does a social difference become a social division?
How do social divisions affect politics?
Give two examples.

social differences do not usually lead to conflicts.

Their medals were taken back.
Norman too suffered for his action and was not included in the Australian team for the next Olympic. But their action succeeded in gaining international attention for the Civil Rights Movement in the US.
Recently, the San Jose (pronounced ‘Saan Hoze’) State University, of which they were former students, honoured them and installed their statue in the University campus.
When Norman died in 2006, Smith and Carlos were pallbearers at his funeral.
eee ee गम िि,++ Some Dalit groups decided to participate in the UN Conference Against Racism in Durban in 2001, demanding the inclusion of caste in the agenda of this conference.
Here are three reactions to this move: Amandeep Kaur (a government official): Our Constitution declares caste discrimination to be illegal.
If some caste discrimination continues, it is an internal matter.
| am opposed to this being raised in an international forum.
Oinam (a sociologist): | am opposed to this because caste and race are not similar divisions.
Caste is a social division, while race is a biological one.
Raising caste in this conference on racism would mean equating the two.
Ashok (a Dalit activist): The argument about internal matter is a way of preventing open discussion of oppression and discrimination.
Race is not purely biological. It is as much a legal and sociological category as caste.
Caste discrimination must be raised in this conference.
Which of the three opinions do you agree with most and why?
eee eee eee नमन बरनन+नन-+/।झ/ए7 Differences, similarities, divisions The athletes in the example above were responding to social divisions and social inequalities.
But does that happen only in societies which have tacial divisions?
In the previous two chapters we have already noted some other forms of social divisions.
The examples of Belgium and Sri Lanka show both regional and social divisions.
In the case of Belgium we noted that people who live in different regions speak different languages.
In Sri Lanka, we noted linguistic as well as religious differences.
Thus social diversity can take different forms in different societies.

Can you list the various kinds of identities Imrana has? At home In terms of religion In the school she is she is she is she is she is a girl SSS Politics of social divisions How do these social divisions affect politics?
What does politics do to these social divisions?
At first sight, it would appear that the combination of politics and social divisions is very dangerous and explosive.
Democracy involves competition among various political parties.
Their competition tends to divide any society.
If they start competing in terms of some existing social divisions, it can make social divisions into political divisions and lead to conflict, violence or even disintegration of a country.
This has happened in many countries.
Range of outcomes Take the case of Northern Ireland that we referred to above.
This region of the United Kingdom has been for many years the site of a violent and bitter ethno-political conflict.
Its population is divided into two major sects of Christianity: 53 per cent are Protestants, while 44 per cent are Roman Catholics.
The Catholics were represented by Nationalist parties who demanded that Northern Ireland be unified with the Republic of Ireland, a predominantly Catholic country.
The Protestants were represented by Unionists who wanted to remain with the UK, which is predominantly protestant.
Hundreds of civilians, militants and security forces were killed in the fight between Unionists and Nationalists and between the security forces of the UK and the Nationalists.
It was only in 1998, that the UK government and the Nationalists @ Orion / Juska Rantanen flickr.com reached a peace treaty after which the latter suspended their armed struggle.
In Yugoslavia, the story did not have a happy end.
Political competition along religious and ethnic lines led to the disintegration of Yugoslavia into six independent countries.
So, it happens all Such examples lead some people over the world, to conclude that politics and social even in Europe!
If social divisions do exist in a country, they must never be expressed in politics.
At the same time every expression of social divisions in politics does not lead to such disasters.
We have already seen that social divisions of one kind ot another exist in most countries of the world.
In a democracy it is only natural that political parties would talk about these [1 1 — if i | ad [ ae — LONDON dee eee ate “(६६६ In some societies of Northern Ireland, the colonies of Protestant and Catholic communities are divided by walls.
These walls are sometimes filled with graffiti as you can see here.
The Irish Republican Army and British Government signed an agreement in 2005.
In many countries there are parties that focus only on one community.
Yet all this does not lead to disintegration of the country.
Three determinants Three factors are crucial in deciding the outcome of politics of social divisions.
First of all the outcome depends on how people perceive their identities.
If people see their identities in singular and exclusive terms, it becomes very difficult to accommodate.
As long as people in northern Ireland saw themselves as only Catholic or Protestant, their differences were difficult to reconcile.
It is much easier if the people see that their identities are multiple and are complementary with the national identity.
A majority of Belgians now feel that they are as much Belgian as they are Dutch or German-speaking.
This helps them to stay together.
This is how most people in our country see their identity: they think of themselves as Indian as well as belonging to a state or a language group or a social or teligious community.
Second, it depends on how political leaders raise the demands of any community.
It is easier to accommodate demands that are within the constitutional framework and are not at the cost of another community.
Ganesh had come back from his trip and was talking to Mahashweta Uu | arla about the Roma people who live in many countries of Eastern 3 Europe.
He met Yordanka who works as a nurse in Bulgaria.
This is Ko man ia what she has to say about Roma people: or “Being a nurse you can’t refuse to look after some people, but ५ 2 these Roma people are very dirty.
Even when something small | ndia ‘ happens to any one in their family, all the family and even the neighbours just march to our hospital. And once they are in the hospital they don’t know how to keep quiet.
They talk aloud, smoke and drop ashes all over and spit on the wall!
They have no patience, and they just start pestering our doctors!
After all these dark skinned people don’t look like us.
They have a strange sense of colour.
Look at their dress, why can’t they try to look like everyone else in the country?
And we all know they are thieves.
| have heard people say that these Roma people live by selling their blood.
None of them can afford the hospital fees.
But when they are ill they just rush to hospital at the cost of good Bulgarians who pay their taxes!” “That sounds familiar’ said Mahashweta.
Ganesh went on to talk about Modruzeni, a Romani who lives in Romania.
When she was eighteen years old, she went to the hospital, to give birth to her first child.
She had no money to pay to the doctor or nurse.
Though she was in the hospital, nobody bothered to come and take care of her.
Finally the sweeper, who was also a Romani, helped her give birth to a boy.
And then the nurse appeared on the scene and said, “Here we have another criminal”. Talking about how the Roma people are treated in public hospitals, she says: “These doctors keep us waiting outside their cabins.
On one occasion one doctor asked me to take a bath if | needed to be examined!
Of course, | smelled.
During the pregnancy | ate from the garbage containers, because | was so hungry all the time.
My husband had left me.
| had two children, and | was pregnant with the third.
The social worker refused my request for food assistance.
My neighbour 2 helped me to deliver the baby.
| often feel it is better not to visit these hospitals.” Mahashweta heard him out and said, “Ganesh, why do you have to travel halfway across the world to find this out?
This is not a story about Romania and Bulgaria or about the Roma people.
This is as much a story about our own country and about our people who are branded as criminals by our system.” @ Do you think Mahashweta is right?
Do you know of some community in your area that is treated like the Romas?
@ = Have you heard people say things similar to what Yordanka or Modruzeni say here?
If yes, try to think of what the story would sound like if you heard it from the other side?
Do you think the Bulgarian government should try to ensure that the Roma people dress and behave like other people from Bulgaria?
Federalism Overview In the previous chapter, we noted that vertical division of power among different levels of governments is one of the major forms of power sharing in modern democracies.
In this chapter, we focus on this form of power sharing.
It is most commonly referred to as federalism.
We begin by describing federalism in general terms.
The rest of the chapter tries to understand the theory and practice of federalism in India.
A discussion of the federal constitutional provisions is followed by an analysis of the policies and politics that has strengthened federalism in practice.
Towards the end of the chapter, we turn to the local government, a new and third tier of Indian federalism.

constitute the zilla (district) parishad.
Most members of the zilla parishad are elected.
Membets of the Lok Sabha and MLAs of that district and some other officials of other district level bodies are also its members.
Zilla parishad chairperson is the political head of the zilla parishad.
Similarly, local government bodies exist for urban areas as well.
Municipalities are set up in towns.
Big cities are constituted into municipal corporations.
Both municipalities and municipal corporations are controlled by elected bodies consisting of people’s tepresentatives.
Municipal chairperson is the political head of the municipality.
In a municipal corporation such an officer is called the mayot.

Prime Minister runs the country.
Chief Minister runs the state.
Logically, then, the chairperson of Zilla Parishad should run the district.

Linguistic diversity of India How many languages do we have in India?
The answer depends on how one counts it.
The latest information that we have is from the Census of India held in 1991.
This census recorded more than 1500 distinct languages which people mentioned as their mother tongues.
These languages were grouped together under some major languages.
For example languages like Bhojpuri, Magadhi, Bundelkhandi, Chhattisgarhi, Rajasthani, Bhili and many others were grouped together under ‘Hindi’.
Even after this grouping, the Census found 114 major languages.
Of these 22 languages are now included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution and are therefore called ‘Scheduled Languages’.
Others are called ‘non- Scheduled Languages’.
In terms of languages, India is perhaps the most diverse country in the world.
A look at the enclosed table makes it clear that no one language is the mother tongue of the majority of our population.
The largest language, Hindi, is the mother tongue of only about 40 per cent Indians.
If we add to that all those who knew Hindi as their second or third language, the total number was still less than 50 per cent in 1991.
As for English, only 0.02 per cent Indians recorded it as their mother tongue.
Another 11 per cent Knew it as a second or third language.
Read this table carefully, but you do not need to memorise it. Just do the following: @ Make a bar or pie chart on the basis of this information.
@ Prepare a map of linguistic diversity of India by shading the region where each of these languages is spoken on the map of India.

rene Indid, Protected States Trivandrum INDIAN What is federalism?
Let us get back to the contrast between Belgium and Sri Lanka that we saw in the last chapter.
You would recall that one of the key changes made in the Constitution of Belgium was to reduce the power of the Central Government and to give these powers to the regional | am confused.
Regional governments existed in Belgium even earlier.
They had their roles and powers.
But all these were these powers given to governments and could be withdrawn by the Central Government.
The change that took place in 1993 was that the regional governments were given constitutional powers that were no longer dependent on the central government.
Thus, Belgium shifted from a unitary to a federal form of government.
Sri Lanka continues to be, Federal political system ow ai Lup Germany Belgium for all practical purposes, a unitary system where the national government has all the powers.
Tamil leaders want Sti Lanka to become a federal system.
Federalism is a system of government in which the power is divided between a central authority and various constituent units of the country.
Usually, a federation has two levels of government.
One is the government for the entire country that is usually responsible for a few subjects of common national interest.
The others are governments at the level of provinces or states that look after much of the day-to-day administering of their state.
Both these levels of governments enjoy their power independent of the other.

Under the unitary system, either there is only one level of government or the sub-units ate subordinate to the central government.
The central government can pass on orders to the provincial or the local government.
The exact balance of power between the central and the state government varies from one federation to another.
In this second category, the central government tends to be more powerful vis-a-vis the States.
Coalition government: A government formed by the coming together of at least two political parties.
Usually partners in a coalition form a political alliance and adopt a common programme.
Language policy A second test for Indian federation is the language policy.
Our Constitution did not give the status of national language to any one language.
Hindi was identified as the official language. But Hindi is the mother tongue of only about 40 per cent of Indians. Therefore, there were many safeguards to protect other languages.
Besides Hindi, there are 21 other languages recognised as the Constitution.
A candidate in an Scheduled Languages by examination conducted for the Central Government positions may opt to take the examination in any of these languages.
States too have their own official languages.
Much of the government work takes place in the official language of the concerned State.
Unlike Sri Lanka, the leaders of our country adopted a very cautious attitude in spreading the use of Hindi.
According to the Constitution, the use of English for official purposes was to stop in 1965. However, many non- Hindi speaking States demanded that the use of English continue.
In Tamil Nadu, this movement took a violent form.
The Central Government responded by agreeing to continue the use of English along with Hindi for official purposes.
Many critics think that this solution favoured the English- speaking elite.
Promotion of Hindi continues to be the official policy of the Government of India. Promotion does not mean that the Central Government can impose Hindi on States where people speak a different language.
The flexibility shown by Indian political leaders helped our country avoid the kind of situation that Sri Lanka finds itself in.
Centre-State relations Restructuring the Centre-State relations is one more way in which federalism has been strengthened in practice.
How the constitutional arrangements for sharing power work in reality depends to a large extent on how the ruling parties and leaders follow these arrangements.
For a long time, the same party ruled both at the Centre and in most of the States.
This meant that the State governments did not exercise their rights as autonomous federal units.
As and when the ruling party at the State level was different, the parties that ruled at the Centre tried to undermine the power of the States.
In those days, the Central Government would often misuse the Constitution to dismiss the State governments that were controlled by rival parties.
This undermined the spirit of federalism.
All this changed significantly after 1990.
This period saw the rise of regional political parties in many States of the country.
This was also the beginning of the era of COALITION GOVERNMENTS at the Centre.
Since no single party got a clear majority in the Lok Sabha, the major national parties had to enter into an alliance with many parties including several regional parties to form a government at the Centre.
This led to a new culture of power sharing and respect for the autonomy of State Governments.
This trend was 4 Us ¢?
a Some Nepalese citizens were discussing the proposals on the adoption of federalism in their new constitution.
It would lead to reservation of seats for different caste groups as in India.
Sarita: Ours in not a very big country.
We don’t need federalism.
Babu Lal: | am hopeful that the Terai areas will get more autonomy if they get their own state government.
Ram Ganesh: | like federalism because it will mean that powers that were earlier enjoyed by the king will now be exercised by our elected representatives.
If you were participating in this conversation what would be your response to each of these?
Which of these reflect a wrong understanding of what federalism is?
What makes India a federal country? We have earlier seen how small countries like Belgium and Sri Lanka face so many problems of managing diversity.
What about a vast country like India, with so many languages, religions and regions?
What are the power sharing arrangements in our country?
Let us begin with the Constitution.
India had emerged as an independent nation after a painful and bloody partition.
Soon after Independence, several princely states became a patt of the country.
The Constitution declared India as a Union of States.
Although it did not use the word federation, the Indian Union is based on the principles of federalism.
Let us go back to the seven features of federalism mentioned above.
We can see that all these features apply to the provisions of the Indian Constitution.
The Constitution originally provided for a two-tier system of government, the Union Government or what we call the Central Government, representing the Union of India and the State governments.
Later, a third tier of federalism was added in the form of Panchayats and Municipalities.
As in any federation, these different tiers enjoy separate jurisdiction.
The Constitution clearly provided a three- fold distribution of legislative powers between the Union Government and the State Governments.
Thus, it contains three lists: @ Union List includes subjects of national importance such as defence of the country, foreign affairs, banking, communications and currency.
They are included in this list because we need a uniform policy on these matters throughout the country.
The Union Government alone can make laws relating to the subjects mentioned in the Union List.
@ State List contains subjects of State and local importance such as police, trade, commerce, agriculture and irrigation.
Decentralisation in India We noted federal governments have two or mote tiers above that of governments.
We have so far discussed the two-tiers of government in our country. But a vast country like India cannot be run only through these two-tiers.
States in India are as large as independent countries of Europe.
In terms of population, Uttar Pradesh is bigger than Russia, Maharashtra is about as big as Germany.
Many of these States are internally very diverse.
There is thus a need for power sharing within these States.
Federal power sharing in India needs another tier of government, below that of the State governments.
This is the rationale for decentralisation of power.
Thus, resulted a third-tier of government, called local government.
When power is taken away from Central and State governments and given to local government, it is called decentralisation.
The basic idea behind decentralisation is that there are a large number of problems and issues which are best settled at the local level.
People have better knowledge of problems in their localities.
They also have better ideas on where to spend money and how to manage things more efficiently.
Besides, at the local level it is possible for the people to directly participate in decision making.
This helps to inculcate a habit of democratic participation.
Local government is the best way to realise one important principle of democracy, namely local self-government.
The need for decentralisation was recognised in our Constitution.
Since then, there have been several attempts to decentralise power to the level of villages and towns.
Panchayats in villages and municipalities in urban areas were set up in all the States.
But these were directly under the control of state governments.
Elections to these local governments were not held regularly.
Local governments did not have any powers or resources of their own.
Thus, there was very little decentralisation in effective terms.
A major step towards decentra- lisation was taken in 1992.
The Constitution was amended to make the third-tier of democracy more powerful and effective.
७ Now it 15 mandatory to hold regular elections to constitutionally local government bodies.
@ Seats are reserved in the elected bodies and the executive heads of these institutions for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.
@ At least one-third of all positions ate reserved for women.
@ An independent institution called the State Election Commission has been created in each State to conduct panchayat and municipal elections.
@ The State governments are required to share some powers and revenue with local government bodies.
The nature of sharing varies from State to State.
Rural local government is popularly known by the name panchayati raj.
Gender, Religion and Caste Overview In the previous chapter we noted that the existence of social diversity does not threaten democracy.
Political expression of social differences is possible and sometimes quite desirable in a democratic system.
In this chapter we apply these ideas to the practice of democracy in India.
We look at three kinds of social differences that can take the form of social divisions and inequalities.
These are social differences based on gender, religion and caste.
In each case we look at the nature of this division in India and how it gets expressed in politics.
We also ask whether different expressions based on these differences are healthy or otherwise in a democracy.
The result of this division of labour is that although women constitute half of the humanity, their role in public life, especially politics, is minimal in most societies.
Earlier, only men were allowed to participate in public affairs, vote and contest for public offices.
Gradually the gender issue was raised in politics.
Women in different parts of the world organised and agitated for equal rights.
There were agitations in different countries for the extension of voting rights to women.
These agitations demanded enhancing the political and legal status of women and improving Scandinavian countties such as Sweden, Norway and Finland, the participation of women in public life is very high.
Do women work more in your family as well?
Do you think America’s and Europe have achieved a satisfactory level of women’s representation?
State different forms of communal politics with one example each.
Communal politics is based on the belief that: A. One religion is superior to that of others.
People belonging to different religions can live together happily as equal citizens.
C. Followers of a particular religion constitute one community.
D. State power cannot be used to establish the domination of one religious group over others.
Which of the statements is/are correct?
(a) A, B, C, and D (b) A, B, andD (c) AandC (d) Band D i . Which among the following statements about India’s Constitution is wrong?
It (a) prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion.
(b) gives official status to one religion.
(c) provides to all individuals freedom to profess any religion.
(d) ensures equality of citizens within religious communities.
Social divisions based on are peculiar to India.
Thus, caste plays different kinds of roles in politics.
In some situations, expression of caste differences in politics gives many disadvantaged communities the space to demand their share of power.
In this sense-caste politics has helped people from Dalits and OBC castes to gain better access to decision making, Several political and non-political organisations have been demanding and agitating for an end to discrimination against particular castes, for more dignity and mote access to land, resources and opportunities. At the same time exclusive attention to caste can produce negative results as well.
As in the case of religion, politics based on caste identity alone is not very healthy in a democracy. It can divert attention from other pressing issues like poverty, development and corruption.
In some cases caste division leads to tensions, conflict and even violence.
Religion, communalism and politics Let us now turn to a very different kind of social division, the division based on religious differences.
This division is not as universal as gender, but religious diversity is fairly widespread in the world today.
Many countries including India have in their population, followers of different religions. As we noticed in the case of Northern Ireland, even when most of the people belong to the same religion, there can be serious differences about the way people practice that religion.
Unlike gender differences, the religious differences ate often expressed in the field of politics.
Consider the following: ® Gandhiji used to say that religion can never be separated from politics.
| a =] — fo en — = हर > particular religion like Hinduism or Islam but moral values that inform all religions.
He believed that politics must be guided by ethics drawn from religion.
® Human rights groups in our country have argued that most of the victims of communal riots in our country are people from religious minorities.
They have demanded that the government take special steps to protect religious minotities.
® Women’s movement has argued that FAMILY LAWS of all religions discriminate against women.
So they have demanded that government should change these laws to make them more equitable.
All these instances involve a relationship between religion and politics.
® The Constitution provides to all individuals and communities freedom to profess, practice and propagate any religion, or not to follow any. ® The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion.
® Atthe same time the Constitution allows the state to intervene in the matters of religion in order to ensure equality within religious communities. For example, it bans untouchability.
Understood in this sense, secularism is not just an ideology of some patties or persons. This idea constitutes one of the foundations of our country.
Communalism should not be seen as a threat to some people in India. It threatens the very idea of India.
That is why communalism needs to be combated.
Communal prejudices and propaganda needs to be Caste and politics We have seen two instances of the expression of social divisions in the arena of politics, one largely positive and the other largely negative.
Let us turn to our final case, that of caste and politics, that has both positive and the negative aspects.
Caste inequalities Unlike gender and religion, caste division is special to India.
All societies have some kind of social inequality and some form of division of labour. In most societies, occupations ate passed on from one generation to another.
Caste system is an extreme form of this. What makes it different from other societies is that in This chair is for the CM-designate, to prove his secular credentials...
Caste system was based on exclusion of and discrimination against the ‘outcaste’ groups. They were subjected to the inhuman practice of untouchability about which you have studied in Class IX.
That is why political leaders and social reformers like Jotiba Phule, Gandhiji, B.R.
Ambedkar and Pertyar Ramaswami © Ajith Ninan - The Times of India OO — © — (० dD) | uv [a - uv OO — uv (2 ® Political parties and candidates in elections make appeals to caste sentiment to muster support.
Some political parties are known to favour some castes and are seen as their representatives, ® Universal adult franchise and the principle of one-person-one-vote compelled political leaders to gear up to the task of mobilising and securing political support.
It also brought new consciousness among the people of castes that were hitherto treated as inferior and low.
The focus on caste in politics can sometimes give an impression that elections are all about caste and nothing else. That is far from true.
Just consider these: ® No parliamentary constituency in the country has a clear majority of one single caste. So, every candidate and party needs to win the confidence of more than one caste and community to win elections.
® No patty wins the votes of all the voters of a caste or community.
When people say that a caste is a ‘vote bank’ of one patty, it usually means that a large proportion of the voters from that caste vote for that party.
® Many political parties may put up candidates from the same caste (if that caste is believed to dominate the electorate in a particular constituency).
Some voters have more than one candidate from their caste while many voters have no candidate from their caste, ® The ruling party and the sitting MP ot MLA frequently lose elections in our country.
That could not have happened if all castes and communities were frozen in their political preferences. Clearly, while caste matters in electoral politics, so do many other factors.
The voters have strong attachment to political parties which is often stronger than their attachment to their caste or community.
People within the same caste or community have different interests depending on their economic condition.
Rich and poor or men and women from the same caste often vote very differently.
People’s assessment of the performance of the government and the popularity rating of the leaders matter and are often decisive in elections.
Politics in caste We have so far looked at what caste does to politics.
But it does not mean that there is only a one-way relation between caste and politics.
Politics too influences the caste system and caste identities by bringing them into the political arena.
Do you think that political leaders are right to treat people belonging to a caste as ‘vote banks’?
© Ajith Ninan - India Today Book of Cartoons OO — © — (० dD) | uv [a - uv OO — uv (2 Naicker advocated and worked to establish a society in which caste inequalities are absent.
Partly due to their efforts and partly due to other socio-economic changes, castes and caste system in modern India have undergone great changes.
With economic development, large scale URBANISATION, growth of literacy and education, OCCUPATIONAL MOBILITY and the weakening of the position of landlords in the villages, the old notions of CASTE HIERARCHY ate breaking down.
Now, most of the times, in urban areas it does not matter much who is walking along next to us on a street or eating at the next table in a restaurant.
The Constitution of India prohibited any caste-based discrimination and laid the foundations of policies to reverse the injustices of the caste system.
Ifa person who lived a century ago were to return to India, she would be greatly surprised at the change that has come about in the country.
Yet caste has not disappeared from contemporary India.
Some of the older aspects of caste have persisted.
Even now most people marry within their own caste or tribe.
Untouchability has not ended completely, despite constitutional prohibition.
The caste groups that had access to education under the old system have done very well in acquiring modern education as well.
Those groups that did not have access to education or were prohibited from acquiring it have naturally lagged behind.
That is why there is a disproportionately large presence of ‘upper caste’ among the urban middle classes in our country.
Caste continues to be closely linked to economic status.
(See Plus Box on Page 52.) Caste in politics As in the case of communalism, casteism is rooted in the belief that caste is the sole basis of social community.
According to this way of thinking, people belonging to the same caste belong to a natural social community and have the same interests which they do not share with anyone from another caste.
As we saw in the case of communalism, such a belief is not borne out by our experience.
Caste is one aspect of our experience but it is not the only relevant ot the most important aspect.
Caste can take various forms in politics: ® When parties choose candidates in elections, they keep in mind the caste composition of the electorate and nominate candidates from different castes so as to muster necessary support to win elections.
When governments are formed, political parties usually take care that representatives of different castes and tribes find a place in it.
Urbanisation: Shift of population from rural areas to urban areas Occupational mobility: Shift from one occupation to another, usually when a new generation takes up occupations other than those practiced by their ancestors.
Caste hierarchy: A ladder like formation in which all the caste groups ate placed from the ‘highest’ to the ‘lowest’ castes.
कक] — (छठ — (० dD) | ५» a4 Ss ५» कक] — ५» का Social and Religious Diversity of India The Census of India records the religion of each and every Indian after every ten years.
The person who fills the Census form visits every household and records the religion of each member of that household exactly the way each person describes it.
If someone says she has ‘no religion’ or that he is an ‘atheist’, this is exactly how it is recorded. Thus we have reliable information on the proportion of different religious communities in the country and how it has changed over the years.
The pie chart below presents the population proportion of six major religious groups in the country.
Since Independence, the total population of each group has increased substantially but their proportion in the country’s population has not changed much.
In percentage terms, the population of the Hindus, Jains and Christians has declined marginally since 1961.
The proportion of Muslim, Sikh and Buddhist population has increased slightly. There is acommon but mistaken impression that the proportion of the Muslims in the country’s population is going to overtake other religious groups.
Expert estimates done for the Prime Minister’s High Level Committee (popularly known as Sachar Committee) show that the proportion of the Muslims is expected to go up a little, by about 3 to 4 per cent, in the next 50 years.
It proves that in overall terms, the population balance of different religious groups is not likely to change in a big way.
The same is true of the major caste groups.
Thus the SC, ST and the OBC together account for about two-thirds of the country’s population and about three-fourths of the Hindu population.
The relationship between caste and economic status has certainly changed a lot.
This was not true even twenty or thirty years ago — it was very rare indeed to find rich people among the ‘lowest’ castes.
Source: National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), Government of India, 55" Round, 1999-2000 But they do not seem very wrong or dangerous. Ideas, ideals and values drawn from different religions can and perhaps should play a role in politics.
People should be able to express in politics their needs, interests and demands as a member of a religious community.
These political acts are not wrong as long as they treat every religion equally.
Communalism The problem begins when religion is seen as the basis of the nation.
The example of Northern Ireland in Chapter 3 shows the dangers of such an approach to nationalism.
The problem becomes more acute when religion is expressed in politics in exclusive and partisan terms, when one religion and its followers are pitted against another.
This happens when beliefs of one religion are presented as superior to those of other religions, when the demands of one religious group are formed in opposition to another and when state power is used to establish domination of one religious group over the rest.
This manner of using religion in politics is communal politics.
Communal politics is based on the idea that religion is the principal basis of social community.
Communalism involves thinking along the following lines.
The followers of a particular religion must belong to one community. Their fundamental interests are the same.
Any difference that they may have is irrelevant or trivial for community life. It also follows that people who follow different religions cannot belong to the same social community. If the followers of different religion have some commonalities these are superficial and immaterial.
Their interests are bound to be different and involve a conflict.
In its extreme form communalism leads to the belief that people belonging to different religions cannot live as equal citizens within one nation.
Either, one of them has to dominate the rest or they have to form different nations.
This belief is fundamentally flawed.
People of one religion do not have the same interests and aspirations in every context.
Everyone has several other roles, positions and identities.
There are many voices inside every community.
All these voices have a right to be heard. Therefore any attempt to bring all followers of one religion together in context other than religion is bound to suppress many voices within that community.
Communalism can take various forms in politics: ® The most common expression of communalism is in everyday beliefs.
These routinely involve religious prejudices, stereotypes of religious communities and belief in the superiority of one’s religion over other religions.
This is so common that we often fail to notice it, even when we believe in it.
® Acommunal mind often leads to a quest for political dominance of one’s own feligious community.
For those belonging to majority community, this takes the form of majoritarian dominance.
For those belonging to the minority community, it can take the form of a desire to form a separate political unit.
This is what the Panchayati Raj has done in India.
Now there are more than 10 lakh elected women representatives in rural and urban local bodies. Women’s organisations and resetvation of at least one-third of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies for women.
A bill with this proposal has been pending before the Parliament for more than a decade. But there is no consensus over this among all the political parties.
Gender division is an example that some form of social division needs to be expressed in politics. This also shows that disadvantaged groups do benefit when social divisions become a political issue.
Do you think that women could have made the gains we noted above if their unequal treatment was not raised If casteism and communalism are bad, what makes feminism a good thing?
Why don’t we oppose all those who divide the society on any lines — caste, religion or activists have been demanding a similar in the political domain? gender?

This is because each one of us has a unique drawing style.
Sometimes, as they began to make their homes in new places, people began to change a little and at other times they managed to do things in the old ways.
The history of many places shows us how many different cultural influences have helped to shape life and culture there. Thus regions became very diverse because of their unique histories.
Similarly diversity also comes about when people adapt their lives to the geographical area in which they live.

SA RARE AR RARE EAT RAR के 2018-19 While Kerala and Ladakh are quite different in terms’ of _ their geographical features, the history of both regions has seen similar cultural influences.
Both regions were influenced by Chinese and Arab traders.
It was the geography of Kerala which allowed for’ the cultivation of spices and the special geographical location of Ladakh and its wool that drew traders to these regions.
Thus history and geography are often tied in the cultural life of a region.
The influence of diverse cultures is not merely a thing of the past.
Our present lives are all about moving from place to place for work and with each move our cultural traditions and way of life slowly become part of the new place we are in.
Similarly in our own neighbourhoods we live close to people from several communities.
Our daily lives are about the ways in which we do things together and hear stories about each other's lives, customs and traditions.
UNITY IN DIVERSITY India's diversity has always been recognised as a source of its strength.
When the British ruled India, women and men from different cultural, religious and regional backgrounds came together to oppose them.
India's freedom movement had thousands of people of different backgrounds in it.
They worked together to decide joint actions, they went to jail together, and they found different ways to oppose the British.
Interestingly the British Understanding Diversity / 11 thought they could divide Indians because they were so different, and then continue to rule them.
But the people showed how they could be different and yet be united in their battle against the British.

Did these differences prevent them from becoming friends?
In this chapter we will carry this discussion further and see how those who exercise power are constrained by the influence and pressure exerted on them.
Democracy almost invariably involves conflict of interests and viewpoints.
These differences are often expressed in organised ways.
Those who are in power are required to balance these conflicting demands and pressures.
We begin this chapter with a discussion of how struggles around conflicting demands and pressures shape democracy.
This leads to an analysis of the different ways and organisations through which ordinary citizen can play a role in democracy.
In this chapter, we look at the indirect ways of influencing politics, through pressure groups and movements.
This leads us in the next chapter to the direct ways of controlling political power in the form of political parties.

Let us read two recent stories of that kind and see how power is exercised in democracy.
Nepal witnessed an extraordinary popular movement in April 2006.
The movement was aimed at restoring democracy. Nepal, you might recall, was one of the ‘third wave’ countries that had won democracy in 1990.
Although the king formally remained the head of the state, the real power was exercised by popularly elected representatives.
King Birendra, who has accepted this transition from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy, was killed in a mysterious massacre of the royal family in 2001.
King Gyanendrta, the new king of Nepal, was not prepared to accept democratic tule.
He took advantage of the weakness and unpopularity of the democratically elected government.
In February 2005, the king dismissed the then Prime Minister and dissolved the popularly elected Parliament.
The movement of April 2006 was aimed at regaining popular control over the government from the king.
© Min Bajarachya Political parties and people of Nepal in a rally demanding restoration of democracy in their country All the major political parties in the parliament formed a Seven Party Alliance (SPA) and called for a four day strike in Kathmandu, the country’s capital.
People defied curfew and took to the streets.
The security forces found themselves unable to take on more than a lakh people who gathered almost every day to demand restoration of democracy.
The number of protesters reached between three to five lakhs on 21 April and they served an ultimatum to the king.
The leaders of the movement rejected the half- hearted concessions made by the king.
They stuck to their demand for restoration of parliament, power to an all-party government and a new constituent assembly.
On 24 April 2004, the last day of the ultimatum, the king was forced to concede all the three demands.
The SPA chose Girija Prasad Koirala as the new Prime Minister of the interim government.
The restored parliament met and passed laws taking away most of the powers of the king.
The SPA and the Maoists came to an understanding about how the new Constituent Assembly was going to be elected.
This struggle came to be known as Nepal’s second movement for democracy.
The struggle of the Nepali people is a source of inspiration to democrats all over the world.
a Maoists: Those communists who believe in the ideology of Mao, the leader of the Chinese revolution.
They seek to overthrow the government through an armed revolution so as to establish the rule of the peasants and workers.
| thought it happened only in our country, because we are not a mature democracy yet.
Bolivia’s Water War The story of Poland and that of Nepal apply to the struggle for establishing or restoring democracy.
Bolivia is a poor country in Latin America.
The World Bank pressurised the government to give up its control of municipal water supply.
The government sold these rights for the city of Cochabamba to a multi-national company (MNC).
The company immediately increased the price of water by four times.
Many people received monthly water bill of Rs 1000 in a country where average income is around Rs 5000 a month.
This led to a spontaneous popular protest.
In January 2000, a new alliance of labour, human rights and community leaders organised a successful four-day general strike in the city.
The government agreed to negotiate and the strike was called off.
Yet nothing happened.
The police resorted to brutal repression when the agitation was started again in February.
Another strike followed in April and the government imposed martial law.
But the power of the people forced the officials of the MNC to flee the city and made the government concede to all the demands of the protesters.
The contract with the MNC was cancelled and water supply was restored to the municipality at old rates.
This came to be known as Bolivia’s water wat.
Democracy and popular struggles These two stories are from very different contexts.
The movement in Nepal was to establish democracy, while the struggle in Bolivia involved claims on an elected, democratic government.
The popular struggle in Bolivia was about one specific policy, while the struggle in Nepal was about the foundations of the country’s politics.
Both these struggles were successful but their impact was at different levels.
Despite these differences, both the stories share some elements which are relevant to the study of the past and future of democracies.
Both these are instances of political conflict that led to popular struggles.
In both cases the struggle involved mass mobilisation.
Public demonstration of mass support clinched the dispute. Finally, both instances involved critical role of political organisations.
If you recall the first chapter of class [X textbook, this is how democracy has evolved all over the world.
We can therefore draw a few conclusions from these examples: ® Democracy evolves through popular strugeles.
It is possible that some significant decisions may take place through consensus and may not involve any conflict at all.
But that would be an exception.
Defining moments of democracy usually involve conflict between those groups who have exercised power and those who aspire for a share in power.
These moments come when the country is going through transition to democracy, expansion of democracy or deepening of democracy.
@® Democratic conflict is resolved through mass mobilisation.

include political parties, pressure groups @ These conflicts and mobilisations are and movement groups.
ar | Us r 7 In 1984, the Karnataka government set up acompany called Karnataka Pulpwood Limited.
About 30,000 hectares of land was given virtually free to this company for 40 years.
Much of this land was used by local farmers as grazing land for their cattle.
However the company began to plant eucalyptus trees on this land, which could be used for making paper pulp.
In 1987, amovement called Kittiko- Hachchiko (meaning, pluck and plant) started a non-violent protest, where people plucked the eucalyptus plants and planted saplings of trees that were useful to the people.
Suppose you belong to any of the following groups, what arguments would you put forward to defend your side: a local farmer, an environmental activist, a government official working in this company or just a consumer of paper.
SSS Mobilisation and organisations Let us go back to our two examples and look at the organisations that made these struggles successful.
We noted that the call for indefinite strike was given by the SPA or the Seven Party Alliance in Nepal.
This alliance included some big parties that had some members in the Parliament.
But the SPA was not the only organisation behind this mass upsurge.
The protest was joined by the Nepalese Communist Party (Maoist) which did not believe in parliamentary democracy.
This party was involved in an armed struggle against the Nepali government and had established its control over large parts of Nepal.
The struggle involved many organisations other than political parties.
All the major labour unions and their federations joined this movement.
Many other organisations like the organisation of the indigenous people, teachers, lawyers and human rights groups extended support to the movement.
© Keshav - The Hindu The Privatisation in Bolivia was not led by protest against water any political party.
It was led by an organisation called FEDECOR.
This organisation comprised of local professionals, including engineers and environmentalists.
They were supported by a federation of farmers who relied on irrigation, the confederation of factory workers’ unions, middle class students from the the University of Cochabamba and the city’s growing population of homeless street children.
The movement was supported by the Socialist Party.
In 2006, this party came to power in Bolivia.
From both these examples we can see that in a democracy several different kinds of organisations work behind any big struggle.
their role in two ways.
One obvious way of influencing the decisions in a democracy is direct participation in competitive politics.
This is done by creating parties, contesting elections and forming governments. But every citizen does not participate so directly.
They may not have the desire, the need or the skills to take part in direct political activity other than voting.
There ate many indirect ways in which people can get governments to listen to their demands or their point of view.
They could do so by forming an organisation and undertaking activities to promote their interest or their viewpoint.
These are called interest groups or pressure groups.
Sometimes people decide to act together without forming organisations.
But poverty remains in the country?
What could be the reasons for such a situation? Bhopal gas victims getting: sub-standard drugs: NGOs *Crhnd asl egies of meuical care bry Stade Tavarmmeai” Pressure groups and Pressure groups are organisations that attempt to influence government policies. But unlike political parties, pressure groups do not aim to directly control or share political power.
These organisations are formed when people with common occupation, interest, aspirations or opinions come together in order to achieve a common objective.
In the course of the discussion above we came across entities that are not quite an organisation.
The struggle in Nepal was called a movement for democracy.
We often hear the word movements people’s movement to describe many forms of collective action: Narmada Bachao Andolan, Movement for Right to Information, Anti-liquor Movement, Women’s Movement, Environmental Movement.
Like an interest group, a movement also attempts to influence politics rather than directly take part in electoral competition.
on a Can you identify the pressure groups functioning in the news clippings given here?
What demand are they making?
लो ie) Popular Struggles and Sectional interest groups and public interest groups Usually interest groups seek to promote the interests of a particular section or group of society.
Trade unions, business associations and professional (lawyers, doctors, teachers, etc.)
bodies are some examples of this type.
They ate sectional because they represent a section of society: workers, employees, business- persons, industrialists, followers of a religion, caste group, etc.
Their principal concern is the betterment and well being of their members, not society in general.
Sometimes these organisations are not about representing the interest of one section of society.
They represent some common or general interest that needs to be defended.
The members of the organisation may not benefit from the cause that the organisation represents.
The Bolivian organisation FEDECOR 1s an example of that kind of an organisation.
In the context of Nepal, we noted the participation of human _ rights organisations.
We read about these organisations in class [X.
These second type of groups are called promotional groups or public interest groups.
They promote collective tather than selective good.
They aim to help groups other than their own members.
For example, a group fighting against bonded labour fights not for itself but for those who are suffering under such bondage.
In some instances the members of a public interest group may undertake activity that benefits them as well as others too.
On June 2004, BAMCEPF (Backward and Minorities about 15,000 landless farmers from West Java, travelled to Jakarta, Community Employees Federation) is an the capital city.
@ wikipedia.com organisation largely made up of against caste discrimination.
It addresses the problems of its members who suffer discrimination. But its principal concern is with social justice and social equality for the entire society.
As in the case of interest groups, the groups involved with movements also include a very wide variety.
The various examples mentioned above already indicate a simple distinction.
Most of the movements are issue specific movements that seek to achieve a single objective within a limited time frame.
Others are more general or generic movements that seek to achieve a broad goal in the very long term. The Nepalese movement for democracy arose with the specific objective of reversing the king’s orders that led to suspension of democracy.
In India, Narmada Bachao Andolan is a good example of this kind of movement.
The movement started with the specific issue of the people displaced by the creation of Sardar Sarovar dam on the Narmada river.
Its objective was to stop the dam from being constructed.
Gradually it became a wider movement that questioned all such big dams and the model of development that required such dams.
Movements of this kind tend to have a clear leadership and some organisation.
But their active life is usually short. These single-issue movements can be contrasted with movements that are long term and involve more than one issue.
The environmental movement and the women’s movement are examples of such movements.
There is no single organisation that controls or guides such movements.
Environmental movement is a label for a large number of organisations and issue-specific movements.
All of these have separate organisation, independent leadership and often different views on policy Social movements and pressure groups try to mobilise citizens in many ways.
The collage here show some of them.

related matters.
Yet all of these shate a broad objective and have a similar approach.
That is why they are called a movement.
Sometimes these broad movements have a loose umbrella organisation as well.
For example, the Social audit uncovers!" ¢ irregularities in Rujasther stoma = a हु National Alliance for Peoples’ Movements (NAPM) is an organisation of organisations.
Various movement groups struggling on specific issues ate constituents of this loose organisation which coordinates the activities of a large number of peoples’ movements in our country.
How do they influence politics?
Pressure groups and movements exert influence on politics in a variety of ways: @ They try to gain public support and sympathy for their goals and their activity by carrying out information campaigns, organising meetings, file petitions, etc.
Most of these groups try to influence the media into giving more attention to these issues.
@ They often organise protest activity like strikes or disrupting government What are the social movements listed in these news clippings?
What efforts are they making? Which sections are they trying to mobilise?
Workers’ organisations, employees’ associations and most of the movement groups often resort to these tactics in order to force the government to take note of their demand.
@ Business groups often employ professional lobbyists or sponsor expensive advertisements.
Some persons from pressure groups of movement groups may participate in official bodies and committees that offer advice to the government.
While interest groups and movements do not directly engage in party politics, they seek to exert influence on political parties.
Most of the movement groups take a political stance without being a party.
The relationship between political parties and pressure groups can take different forms, some direct and others very indirect: @® In some instances the pressure groups are either formed or led by the leaders of political parties or act as extended arms of political parties.
For example, most trade unions and students’ organisations in India are either established by or affiliated to one or the other major political party.
Most of the leaders of such pressure groups are usually activists and leaders of party.
® Sometimes political parties grow out of movements.
For example, when the Assam movement led by students against the ‘foreigners’ came to an end, it led to the formation of the Asom Gana Parishad.
The roots of parties like the DMK and the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu can be traced to a long drawn social reform movement during the 1930 and 1940s, @® In most cases the relationship between parties and interest or movement groups is not so direct.
They often take positions that are opposed to each other. Yet they are in dialogue and negotiation.
Movement groups have taised new issues that have been taken up by political parties.
Most of the new leadership of political parties comes from interest or movement groups.
Tt may initially appear that it is not healthy for groups that promote interest of one section to have influence in democracy.
A democracy must look after the interest of all, not just one section. Also, it may seem that these groups wield power without responsibility.

Popular Struggles and 2 The Green Belt Movement has planted 30 million trees across Kenya.
Its leader Wangari Maathai is very disappointed with the response of government officials and politicians: “In the 1970s and 1980s, as | was encouraging farmers to plant trees on their land, | also discovered that corrupt government agents were responsible for much of the deforestation by illegally selling off land and trees to well-connected developers.
In the early 1990’s, the livelihoods, the rights and even the lives of many Kenyans in the Rift Valley were lost when elements of President Daniel Arap Moi’s government encouraged ethnic communities to attack one another over land.
Supporters of the ruling party got the land, while those in the pro-democracy movement were displaced.
This was one of the government’s ways of retaining power; if communities were kept busy fighting over land, they would have less opportunity to demand democracy.” In the above passage what relationship do you see between democracy and social movements?

Mewat is one of the most backward areas in Haryana.
It used to be a part of district Gurgaon and Faridabad.
The people of Mewat felt that the area will get better attention if it were to become a separate district.
But political parties were indifferent to this sentiment.
The demand for a separate district was raised by Mewat Educational and Social Organisation and Mewat Saksharta Samiti in 1996.
Later Mewat Vikas Sabha was founded in 2000 and carried out a series of public awareness campaigns.
This forced both the major parties, Congress and the Indian National Lok Dal, to announe their support for the new district before the assembly elections held in February 2005.
The new district came into existence in July 2005.
In this example what is the relationship that you observe among movement, political parties and the government?

Overview With this chapter we resume the tour of democracy that we started last year.
We noted last year that in a democracy all power does not rest with any one organ of the state.
An intelligent sharing of power among legislature, executive and judiciary is very important to the design of a democracy.
In this and the next two chapters we carry this idea of power sharing forward.
We start with two stories from Belgium and Sri Lanka.
Both these stories are about how democracies handle demands for power sharing.The stories yield some general conclusions about the need for power sharing in democracy.
This allows us to discuss various forms of power sharing that will be taken up in the following two chapters.
Chapter | MO पयकायद्रागफए (610७ sary Ethnic: A social division based on shared culture.
People belonging to the same ethnic group believe in their common descent because of similarities of physical type or of culture or both.
They need not always have the same religion or nationality.
Belgium and Sri Lanka Belgium is a small country in Europe, smaller in area than the state of It has with Netherlands, France and Germany.
borders has a population of a little over one crore, about half the population of Haryana.
The ETHNIC composition of this small country is very complex.
Of the country’s total population, 59 per cent lives in the Flemish region and speaks Dutch language.
Another 40 per cent people live in the Wallonia region and speak French.
Remaining | per cent of the Belgians speak German.
In the capital city Brussels, 80 per cent people speak French while 20 per cent are Dutch-speaking, The minority French-speaking community was relatively rich and powerful.
This was resented by the Dutch-speaking community who got the benefit of economic development © Wikipedia नये Brussels-Capital Region | | Walloon (French-speaking) | | Flemish (Dutch-speaking) LA German-speaking and education much later.
This led to tensions between the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities during the 1950s and 1960s.
The tension between the two communities was more acute in Brussels.
Brussels presented a special problem: the Dutch-speaking people constituted a majority in the country, but a minority in the capital.
Let us compare this to the situation in another country.
Sri Lanka is an island nation, just a few kilometres off the southern coast of Tamil Nadu.
It has about 2 crore people, about the same as in Haryana.
Like other nations in the South Asia region, Sri Lanka has a diverse population.
The major social groups are the Sinhala-speakers (74 per cent) and the Tamil-speakers (18 per cent).
Among Tamils there are two sub- groups.
Tamil natives of the country Communities and regions of Belgium Look at the maps of Belgium and Sri Lanka.
In which region do you find concentration of different communities?
The rest, whose forefathers came from India as plantation workers during colonial period, are called ‘Indian Tamils’.
As you can see from the map, Soi Lankan Tamils are concentrated in the north and east of the country.
Most of the Sinhala-speaking people are Buddhist, while most of the Tamils are Hindus or Muslims.
Majoritarianism in Sri Lanka Sti Lanka emerged as an independent country in 1948.
The leaders of the Sinhala community sought to secure dominance over government by virtue of their majority.
As a result, the democratically elected government adopted a series of MAJORITARIAN measutes to establish Sinhala supremacy.
In 1956, an Act was passed to recognise Sinhala as the only official language, thus disregarding Tamil.
The governments followed preferential policies that favoured Sinhala applicants for university positions and government jobs.
A new constitution stipulated that the state shall protect and foster Buddhism.
All these government measutes, coming one after the other, gradually increased the feeling of alienation among the Sri Lankan Tamils.
They felt that none of the major political parties led by the Buddhist Sinhala leaders were sensitive to their language and culture.
They felt that the constitution and government policies denied them equal political rights, discriminated against them in getting jobs and other opportunities and ignored their interests.
As a result, the relations Ethnic Communities a Sri Lanka Sinhalese Sri Lankan Tamil i) Indian Tamil il Muslim 1% 610७: ary Majoritarianism: A belief that the majority community should be able to rule a country in whichever way it wants, by disregarding the wishes and needs of the minority.

The Sri Lankan Tamils launched patties and struggles for the recognition of Tamil as an official language, for regional autonomy and equality of opportunity in securing education and jobs.
But their demand for more autonomy to provinces populated by the Tamils was repeatedly denied.
By 1980s several political organisations were formed demanding an independent Tamil Eelam (state) in northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka.
The distrust between the two communities turned into widespread conflict.
Accommodation in Belgium The Belgian leaders took a different path.
They recognised the existence of regional differences and cultural diversities.
Between 1970 and 1993, they amended their constitution four times so as to work out an arrangement that would enable everyone to live together within the same country.
The arrangement they worked out is different from any other country and is very innovative.
Here are some of the elements of the Belgian model: ® Constitution prescribes that the number of Dutch and French-speaking ministers shall be equal in the central government.
Some special laws require the support of majority of members from each linguistic group.
Thus, no single community can make decisions unilaterally.
@ Many powers of the central government have been given to state governments of the two regions of the country. The state governments are not subordinate to the Central Government.
@ Brussels has a separate government in which both the communities have equal representation.
The French- speaking people accepted equal representation in Brussels because the Dutch-speaking community has accepted equal representation in the Central Government.

@ Find out the cause of each of these conflicts.
How many of these are related to power sharing disputes?
@ Which of these conflicts could be resolved by working out power sharing arrangements?
ls What do we learn from these two stories of Belgium and Sri Lanka?
Both are democracies.
Yet, they dealt with the question of power sharing differently.
In Belgium, the leaders have realised that the unity of the country is possible only by respecting the feelings and interests of different communities and regions.
Such a realisation resulted in mutually acceptable arrangements for sharing power.
Sri Lanka shows us a contrasting example.
It shows us that if a majority community wants to force its dominance over others and refuses to share power, it can undermine the unity of the country.
© Tab - The Calgary Sun, Cagle Cartoons Inc. Why power sharing is desirable?
Thus, two different sets of reasons can be given in favour of power sharing.
Firstly, power sharing is good because it helps to reduce the possibility of conflict between social groups.
Since social conflict often leads to violence and political instability, power sharing is a good way to ensure the stability of political order.
Imposing the will of majority community over others may look like an attractive option in the short run, but in the long run it undermines the unity of the nation.
-_— वेब The cartoon at the left refers to the problems of running the Germany’s grand coalition government that include the two major parties of the country, namely the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party.
The two parties are historically rivals to each other.
They have to form a coalition government because neither of them got clear majority of seats on their own in the 2005 elections.
They take divergent positions on several policy matters, but still jointly run the government.
Tyranny of the majority is not just oppressive for the minority; it often brings ruin to the majority as well.
There is a second, deeper reason why power sharing is good for democracies.
Power sharing is the very spirit of democracy.
People have a right to be consulted on how they are to be governed.
A_ legitimate government is one where citizens, through participation, acquire a stake in the system.
Let us call the first set of reasons PRUDENTIAL and the second moral.
While prudential reasons stress that power sharing will bring out better outcomes, moral reasons emphasises the very act of power sharing as valuable. Annette studies in a Dutch medium school in the northern region of Belgium.

Kh | | As usual, Vikram’s was driving the motorbike under a vow ais of silence and Vetal was the pillion rider.
As usual, Vetal dilemma started telling Vikram a story to keep him awake while driving.
This time the story went as follows: “In the city of Beirut there lived a man called Khalil.
His parents came from different communities.
His father was an Orthodox Christian and mother a Sunni Muslim.
This was not so uncommon in this modern, cosmopolitan city.
People from various communities that lived in Lebanon came to live in its capital, Beirut.
They lived together, intermingled, yet fought a bitter civil war among themselves.
One of Khalil’s uncles was killed in that war.
At the end of this civil war, Lebanon’s leaders came together and agreed to some basic rules for power sharing among different communities.
As per these rules the country’s President must belong to the Maronite sect of Catholic Christians. The Prime Minister must be from the Sunni Muslim community.
The post of Deputy Prime Minister is fixed for Orthodox Christian sect and that of the Speaker for Shi’a Muslim.
Under this pact, the Christians agreed not to seek French protection and the Muslim agreed not to seek unification with the neighbouring state of Syria.When the Christians and Muslims came to this agreement, they were nearly equal in population.
Both sides have continued to respect this agreement though now the Muslims are in clear majority.
Khalil does not like this system one bit. He is a popular man with political ambition.
But under the present system the top position is out of his reach barred from him.
He does not practice either his father’s or his mother’s religion and does not wish to be known by either.
He cannot understand why Lebanon can’t be like any other ‘normal’ democracy.
“Just hold an election, allow everyone to contest and whoever wins maximum votes becomes the president, no matter which community he comes from.
His elders, who have seen the bloodshed of the civil war, tell him that the present system is the best guarantee for peace..’ The story was not finished, but they had reached the TV tower where they stopped every day.
Vetal wrapped up quickly and posed his customary question to Vikram: “If you had the power to rewrite the rules in Lebanon, what would you do?
Or stick to the old rules?
Or do something else?” Vetal did not forget to remind Vikram of their basic pact: “If you have an answer in mind and yet do not speak up, your mobike will freeze, and so will you!” Can you help poor Vikram in answering Vetal?
Reigning Reins ugar) GOTTA KEEP THE REIN TIGHT, VLADIMIR... Forms of power sharing The idea of power sharing has emerged in opposition to the notions of undivided political power.
For a long time it was believed that all power of a government must reside in one person or group of persons located at one place.
It was felt that if the power to decide is dispersed, it would not be possible to take quick decisions and to enforce them.
One basic principle of democracy is that people are the source of all political power.
people themselves through institutions of In a democracy, tule self-governance.
In a good democratic government, due respect is given to diverse groups and views that exist in a society. Everyone has a voice in the shaping of public policies.
pr GN Recently some new laws were made in Russia giving more powers to its president.
During the same time the US president visited Russia.
What, according to this cartoon, is the relationship between democracy and concentration of power?
Can you think of some other examples to illustrate the point being made here?
In modern democracies, power sharing arrangements can take many forms.
Let us look at some of the most common arrangements that we have or will come across. Power is shared among different otgans of government, such as the legislature, executive and judiciary.
Let us call this horizontal distribution of power because it allows different organs of government placed at the same level to exercise different powers.
Such a separation ensures that none of the organs can exercise unlimited power.
Each organ checks the others.
This results in a balance of power among various institutions.
Last year we studied that in a democracy, even though ministers and government officials exercise power, they are responsible to the Parliament or State Assemblies. Similarly, although judges are appointed by the executive, they can check the functioning of executive or laws made by the legislatures.
This arrangement is called a system of checks and balances.
Power can be shared among governments at different levels — a general government for the entire country and governments at the provincial or regional level. Such a general government for the entire country is usually called federal government.
In India, we refer to it as the Central or Union Government. The governments at the provincial or regional level are called by different names in different countries.
In India, we call them State Governments.
This system is not followed in all countries.
There are many countries where there are no provincial or state governments.
But in those countries like ours, where there are different levels of governments, the constitution clearly lays down the powers of different levels of government.
This is what they did in Belgium, but was refused in Sri Lanka.
The same principle can be extended to levels of government lower than the State government, such as the municipality and panchayat.
Let us call division of powers involving higher and lower levels of government vertical division of power.
We shall study these at some length in the next chapter.
Power may also be shared among different social groups, such as the teligious and linguistic groups.
‘Community government’ in Belgium is a good example of this arrangement.
In some countries there are constitutional and legal arrangements whereby socially weaker sections and women are represented in the legislatures and administration.
Last year we studied the system of ‘reserved constituencies’ in assemblies and the parliament of our country.
This type of arrangement is meant to give space in the government and administration to diverse social groups who otherwise would feel alienated from the government.
This method is used to give minority communities a fair share in power.
In Chapter 3, we shall look at various ways of accommodating social diversities.
a3) Power sharing arrangements can also be seen in the way political parties, pressure groups and movements control or influence those in power.
In a democracy, the citizens must have freedom to choose among various contenders for power.
In contemporary democracies this takes the form of competition among different parties.
Such competition ensures that power does not remain in one hand. In the long run power is shared among different political parties that represent different ideologies and social groups.
Sometimes this kind of sharing can be direct, when two or more parties form an alliance to contest elections.
In a democracy, we find interest groups such as those of traders, businessmen, industrialists, farmers and industrial workers.
They also will have a share in governmental power, either through participation in governmental committees or bringing influence on the decision making process.
In Chapter 4, we shall study the working of political parties, pressure groups and social movements.

5. Read the following passage and pick out any one of the prudential reasons for power sharing offered in this.
“We need to give more power to the panchayats to realise the dream of Mahatma Gandhi and the hopes of the makers of our Constitution.
Panchayati Raj establishes true democracy.
It restores power to the only place where power belongs in a democracy — in the hands of the people.
Giving power to Panchayats is also a way to reduce corruption and increase administrative efficiency.
When people participate in the planning and implementation of developmental schemes, they would naturally exercise greater control over these schemes.
This would eliminate the corrupt middlemen.
Thus, Panchayati Raj will strengthen the foundations of our democracy.” 6.

Overview In this tour of democracy we have come across political parties several times.
In Class IX, we noticed the role of political parties in the rise of democracies, in the formation of constitutional designs, in electoral politics and in the making and working of governments.
In this textbook, we have glanced at political parties as vehicles of federal sharing of political power and as negotiator of social divisions in the arena of democratic politics.
Before concluding this tour, let us take a close look at the nature and working of political parties, especially in our country.
We begin by asking two common questions: Why do we need parties?
How many parties are good for a democracy?
In the light of these we introduce the national and regional political parties in today’s India and then look at what is wrong with political parties and what can be done about it.
Chapter 6 Political parties are easily one of the most So, you agree with me.
For most ordinary citizens, democracy is equal to political parties.
If you travel to remote parts of our country and speak to the less educated citizens, you could come across people who may not know anything about our Constitution or about the nature of our government.
But chances are that they would know something about our political parties.
At the same time this visibility does not mean popularity.
Most people tend to be very critical of political parties.
blame parties for all that is wrong with out democracy and our political life.
Parties have become identified with social and political divisions.
Therefore, it is natural to ask — do we need political parties at allP About hundred years ago there were few countries of the world that had any political party.
Now there are few that do not have parties.
Why did political parties become so omnipresent in democracies all over the world?
Let us first answer what political parties are and what they do, before we say why we need them.
Meaning A political party is a group of people who come together to contest elections and hold power in the government.
They agree on some policies and programmes for the society with a view to promote the collective good.
Since there can be different views on what is good for all, © RK Laxman - Brushing up the years patties try to persuade people why their policies are better than others.
They seek to implement these policies by winning popular support through elections.
Thus, parties reflect fundamental political divisions in a society.
Parties are about a part of the society and thus involve PARTISANSHIP.
Thus a party is known by which patt it stands for, which policies it supports and whose interests it upholds.
A political party has three components: ® the leaders, ® the active members and ® the followers Functions What does a political party do?
Basically, political parties fill political offices and exercise political power.
In most democracies, elections are fought mainly WHERE HAVE ALL ne OUR LEADERS GoNE ATO TIME LIKE THIS? among the candidates put up by political parties.
Parties select their candidates in different ways.
In some countries, such as the USA, members and supporters of a party choose its candidates.
Now more and more countries are following this method.
In other countries like India, top party leaders choose candidates for contesting elections.
Parties put forward different policies and programmes and the voters choose from them.
Each of us may have different opinions and views on what policies are suitable for the society.
But no government can handle such a large variety of views.
In a democracy, a large number of similar opinions have to be grouped together to provide a direction in which policies can be formulated by the governments.
This is what the parties do.
Ruling Party: Political party that runs government. a few basic positions which it supports.
A government is expected to base its policies on the line taken by the RULING PARTY.
Parties play a decisive role in making laws for a country.
Formally, laws are debated and passed in the legislature.
But since most of the members belong to a party, they go by the direction of the party leadership, irrespective of their personal opinions.
Parties form and run governments.
As we noted last year, the big policy decisions are taken by political executive that comes from the political parties.
Parties recruit leaders, trains them and then make them ministers to run the government in the way they want.
Those parties that lose in the elections play the role of opposition to the parties in power, by voicing different views and criticising government for its failures or wrong policies.
Opposition parties also mobilise opposition to the government.
Parties shape public opinion.
They raise and highlight issues.
Parties have lakhs of members and activists spread all over the country.
Many of the pressure groups ate the extensions of political parties among different sections of society.
Parties sometimes also launch movements for the resolution of problems faced by people.
Often opinions in the society crystallise on the lines parties take.
Parties provide people access to government machinery and welfare schemes implemented by governments.
For an ordinary citizen it is easy to approach a local party leader than a government officer.
That is why they feel close to parties even when they do not fully trust them.
Parties have to be tesponsive to people’s needs and demands. Otherwise people can reject those parties in the next elections.
Necessity This list of functions in a sense answers the question asked above: we need political parties because they perform all these functions.
But we still need to ask why modern democracies cannot exist without political parties.
We can understand the necessity of political parties by imagining a situation without parties.
Every candidate in the elections will be independent.
So no one will be able to make any promises to the people about any major policy changes.
The government may be formed, but its utility will remain ever uncertain.
Elected representative will be accountable to their constituency for what they do in the locality.
But no one will be responsible for how the country run.
We can also think about it by looking at the non-party based elections to the panchayat in many states.
Although, the parties do not contest formally, it is generally noticed that the village gets split into more than one faction, each of which puts up a ‘panel’ of its candidates. This is exactly what the party does.
That is the reason we find political parties in almost all countries of the world, whether these countries are big or small, old or new, developed or developing, The tise of political parties is directly linked to the representative democracies.
As we have emergence of seen, large scale societies need representative democracy.
As societies became large and complex, they also needed some agency to gather different views on various issues and to present these to the government.
Political parties fulfill these needs that every representative government has. some way to.
bring various representatives together so that a responsible government could be formed.
They needed a mechanism to We can say that parties are a necessary support or restrain the government, condition for a democracy.

In a democracy any group of citizens is free to form a political party.
In this formal sense there are a large number of political parties in each country.
More than 750 parties are registered with the Election Commission of India.
But not all these parties are serious contenders in the elections.
Usually only a handful of parties are effectively in the race to win elections and form the government.
So the question then is: how many major ot effective parties are good for a democracy?
In some countries only one party is allowed to control and run the government.
© Zuban A moral force न What did Kishenji mean by an alternative political formation?
question came up in a conversation between Sudha, Karuna, Pp * Shaheen and Gracy.
All four women had led very powerful people’s movements in different parts of the country.
They were meeting in a village in Orissa, away from their day-to-day struggles, to think afresh the future of people’s movements.
The discussion naturally turned to Kishenji, who was regarded as a friend, political philosopher and moral guide by all the movement groups in the country.
His argument was simple yet powerful. Movements focused on a single issue are suitable as long as we wish to achieve limited changes in a particular aspect of life.
But if we wish to bring about a fundamental social transformation, or basic change even in one aspect of life, we would need a political organisation.
People’s movement must establish a new political formation to act as a moral force in politics.
This was an urgent task, he said, because all the existing political parties had become irrelevant for social transformation.
“But Kishenji never clarified what that organisation will be.
He talked of an alternative political formation or a third force in politics.
But did he mean a political party?” said Gracy. She felt that an old style political party was not the right instrument for social change.
Sudha agreed with her. “| have thought about it several times.
| agree that all the struggles that we are involved with — the struggle against displacement, against globalisation, against caste and gender oppression and for an alternative kind of development — all this is political. But the moment we form a party, all the goodwill we have earned all these years will be lost.
People will think of us as no different from other politicians.” “Besides”, added Karuna, “we have seen that a lot can be achieved by putting pressure on the छल फेल ike एंमीन॑ existing political parties.
We tried putting up a candidates in panchayat elections, but the results a ज़नत क॑ अधीन || were not very encouraging.
People respect our Le Sot Loveless dang work, they even adore us, but when it comes to voting they go for the established political parties.” Shaheen did not agree with them: “Let us be very clear.
Kishenji wanted all the people’s movements to forge a new political party. Of course he wanted this party to be a different kind of a party.
He was not for political alternatives, but for an alternative kind of politics.” Kishenji is no more.
What would be your advice to these four activists?
Should they form anew political party?
Can a political ai LATS Eales party become a moral force in politics?
ALL MAD iP should that party be like?
Serres eB In Class 120, we noted that in China, only the Communist Party is allowed to tule.
Although, legally speaking, people are free to form political parties, it does not happen because the electoral system does not permit free competition for power.
We cannot consider one party system as a good option because this is not a democratic option.
Any democratic system must allow at least two parties to compete in elections and provide a fair chance for the competing patties to come to power.
In some countries, power usually changes between two main parties.
If several parties compete for power, and more than two parties have a reasonable chance of coming to power either on their own strength ot in alliance with others, we call it a multi-party system.
Thus in India, we have a multi-party system.
In this system, the government is formed by various parties coming together in a fe 1 coalition.
When several parties in a multi-party system join hands for the purpose of contesting elections and winning power, it is called an alliance or a front.
For example, in India there were three such major alliances in 2004 parliamentary elections— the National Democratic Alliance, the United Progressive Alliance and the Left Front.
The multi-party system often appears very messy and leads to political instability. At the same time, this system allows a variety of interests and opinions to enjoy political representation.
So, which of these is better?
Perhaps the best answer to this very common question is that this is not a very good question.
Party system is not something any country can choose.
It evolves over along time, depending on the nature of society, its social and regional divisions, its history of politics and its system of elections.
These cannot be changed very quickly.
Each country develops a party system that is conditioned by its special circumstances.
For example, if India has evolved a multi-party system, it is because the social and geographical diversity in such a large country is not easily absorbed by two or even three parties.
ioe? e~ Let us apply what we have learnt about party systems to the various states within India.
Here are three major types of party systems that exist at the State level.
Can you find the names of at least two States for each of these types?
® Two-party system @ Multi-party system with two alliances ® Multi-party system P opular p pa rtici pa tion , It is often said that political parties are facing , in , a crisis because they are very unpopular and politica | pa rties the citizens are indifferent to political parties.
The available evidence shows that this belief is only partly true for India.
The evidence, based on a series of large sample surveys conducted over several decades, shows that: ® Political parties do not enjoy much trust among the people in South Asia.
The proportion of those who say their trust in political parties is ‘not much’ or ‘not at all’ is more than those who have ‘some’ or ‘great’ trust.
® The same is true of most other democracies as well.
Political parties are one of the least trusted institutions all over the world.
® Yet the level of participation in the activities of political parties was fairly high.
The proportion of those who said they were members of some political party was higher in India than many advanced countries like Canada, Japan, Spain and South Korea.

National political parties Democracies that follow a federal system all over the world tend to have two kinds of political parties: parties that are present in only one of the federal units and parties that are present in several or all units of the federation.
This is the case in India as well.
There are some country- wide parties, which are called ‘national parties’.
These parties have their units in various states.
But by and large all these units follow the same policies, programmes and strategy that is decided at the national level.
Every party in the country has to register with the Election Commission.
While the Commission treats all parties equally, it offers some special facilities to large and established parties.
These patties are given a unique symbol — only the official candidates of that party can use that election symbol.
Parties that get this privilege and some other special facilities are ‘recognised’ by the Election Commission for this purpose.
The Election Commission has laid down detailed criteria of the proportion of votes and seats that a party must get in order to be a recognised party.
A party that secures at least 6 per cent of the total votes in an election to the Legislative Assembly of a State and wins at least two seats is recognised as a State party.
A party that secures at least six per cent of total votes in Lok Sabha elections or Assembly elections in four States and wins at least four seats in the Lok Sabha is recognised as a national party.
According to this classification, there were six national recognised parties in the country in 2006.
Let us learn something about each of these parties.

This made the Parliament of India politically more and more diverse.
No one national party is able to secure on its own a majority in Lok Sabha.
As a result, the national parties are compelled to form alliances with State parties.
Since 1996, nearly every one of the State parties has got an opportunity to be a part of one or the other national level coalition government.
This has contributed to the strengthening of federalism and democracy in our country. (See the map on the next page for details of these patties).

Challenges to political parties We have seen how crucial political parties are for the working of democracy.
Since parties are the most visible face of democracy, itis natural that people blame parties for whatever is wrong with the working of democracy.
All over the world, people dissatisfaction with the failure of political parties to perform their functions well.
express 5 trong This is the case in our country too.
Popular dissatisfaction and criticism has focussed on four problem areas in the Berlusconi Puppet Theatre working of political parties.
Political parties need to face and overcome these challenges in order to remain effective instruments of democracy.
The first challenge is lack of internal democracy within parties.
All over the world there is a tendency in the concentration of power in one or few political parties towards leaders at the top.
Parties do not keep membership registers, do not hold organisational meetings, and do not conduct internal elections regularly.
Ordinary members of the party do not get sufficient information on what happens inside the party.
They do not have the means or the connections needed to influence the decisions.
As a result the leaders assume greater power to make decisions in the name of the party.
Since one or few leaders exercise paramount power in the party, those who disagree with the leadership find it Berlusconi was the Prime Minister of Italy.
He is also one of the top business man in Italy.
He is the leader of the Forza Italia founded in 1993.
His company owns TV channels, the most important publishing company, a foot ball club (AC Milan) and a bank.
This cartoon was made during the last elections.
COM --+-्2्?ओऑ सा - difficult to continue in the party.
More than loyalty to party principles and policies, personal loyalty to the leader becomes more important.
The second challenge of dynastic succession is related to the first one.
Since most political parties do not practice open and transparent procedures for their functioning, there are very few ways for an ordinary worker to rise to the top in a party.
Those who happen to be the leaders are in a position of unfair advantage to favour people close to them or even their family members.
In many parties, the top positions are always controlled by members of one family.
This is unfair to other members of that party.
This is also bad for democracy, since people who do not have adequate experience or popular support come to occupy positions of power.
This tendency is present in some measure all over the world, including in some of the older democracies.
NE-PARTY OUNTRY The third challenge is about the growing role of money and muscle power in parties, especially during elections.
Since parties are focussed only on winning elections, they tend to use short-cuts to win elections.
They tend to nominate those candidates who have or can raise lots of money.
Rich people and companies who give funds to the parties tend to have influence on the policies and decisions of the party.
In some cases, parties support criminals who can win elections.
Democrats all over the world are wotried about the increasing role of rich people and big companies in democratic politics.
The fourth challenge is that very often parties do not seem to offer a meaningful choice to the voters.
In order to offer meaningful choice, parties must be significantly different.
In recent years there has been a decline in the ideological differences among patties in most parts of the world.
For example, the difference between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party in Britain is very little.
They agree on more fundamental aspects but differ only in details on how policies ate to be framed and implemented.
In our country too, the differences among all the major patties on the economic policies have reduced.
Those who want really different policies have no option available to them.
Sometimes people cannot even elect very different leaders either, because the same set of leaders keep shifting from one party to another.
Why do you want to contest the elections? हट .
© Maniul - DNA 5 x e” Most cartoons caricature politicians.
From the cartoons (on page 83 to 85), can you identify which of the challenges described in this section is being highlighted in these cartoons.
They relate to Italy, US and India.
How can parties be reformed?
In order to face these challenges, political parties need to be reformed.
The question is: Are political parties willing to reform?
If they are not willing, is it possible to force them to reform?
Citizens all over the world face this question.
This is not a simple question to answer.
In a democracy, the final decision is made by leaders who represent political parties.
People can replace them, but only by another set of party leaders.
If all of them do not wish to reform, how can anyone force them to change?
Let us look at some of the recent efforts and suggestions in our country to reform political parties and its leaders: ® The Constitution was amended to prevent elected MLAs and MPs from changing parties.
This was done because many elected representatives were indulging in DEFECTION in order to become ministers or for cash rewards.

® The Supreme Court passed an order to reduce the influence of money and criminals.
Now, it is mandatory for every candidate who contests elections to file an AFFIDAVIT giving details of his property and criminal cases pending against him.
The new system has made a lot of information available to the public. But there is no system of check if the information given by the candidates is true.
As yet we do not know if it has led to decline in the influence of the rich and the criminals.
® The Election Commission passed an order making it necessary for political parties to hold their organisational elections and file their income tax returns.
The parties have started doing so but sometimes it is mere formality.
It is not clear if this step has led to greater internal democracy in political parties.
Besides these, many suggestions are often made to reform political parties: ® A law should be made to regulate the internal affairs of political parties.
It should be made compulsory for political parties to maintain a register of its members, to follow its own constitution, to have an independent authority, to act as a judge in case of party disputes, to hold open elections to the highest posts.
® It should be made mandatory for political parties to give a minimum number of tickets, about one-third, to women candidates.
Similarly, there should be a quota for women in the decision making bodies of the party.
The government should give parties money to support their election expenses.
This support could be given in kind: petrol, paper, telephone etc. Or it could be given in cash on the basis of the votes secured by the party in the last election.
These suggestions have not yet been accepted by political parties.
If and when these are accepted these could lead to some improvement.
But we must be very careful about legal solutions to political problems.
Over-regulation of political parties can be counter- productive.
This would force all parties to find ways to cheat the law.
Besides, political parties will not agree to pass a law that they do not like.
There are two other ways in which political parties can be reformed.
One, people can put pressure on political parties.
This can be done through petitions, publicity and agitations.
Ordinary citizens, pressure groups and movements and the media can play an important role in this.
If political parties feel that they would lose public support by not taking up reforms, they would become more serious about reforms.
Two, political parties can improve if those who want this join political parties.
The quality of democracy depends on the degree of public participation.
It is difficult to reform politics if ordinary citizens do not take part in it and simply ctiticise it from the outside.
The problem of bad politics can be solved by more and better politics.
We shall return to this theme in the final chapter.

Read the following passage and answer the questions given below: Muhammad Yunus is a famous economist of Bangladesh.
He received several international honours for his efforts to promote economic and social development for the benefit of the poor.
He and the Grameen Bank he started jointly, received the Nobel Peace Prize for the 2006.
In February 2007, he decided to launch a political party and contest in the parliamentary elections.
His objective was to foster proper leadership, good governance and build a new Bangladesh.
He felt that only a political party different from the traditional ones would bring about new political culture.
His party would be democratic from the grassroots level.
The launching of the new party, called Nagarik Shakti (Citizens’ Power), has caused a stir among the Bangladeshis.
While many welcomed his decision, some did not like it.
“Now | think Bangladesh will have a chance to choose between good and bad and eventually have a good government,” said Shahedul Islam, a government official.
“That government, we hope, would not only keep itself away from corruption but also make fighting corruption and black money a top priority.” But leaders of traditional political parties who dominated the country’s politics for decades were apprehensive.
“There was no debate (over him) winning the Nobel, but politics is different — very challenging and often controversial,” said a senior leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
Some others were highly critical.
They asked why he was rushing into politics.
“ls he being planted in politics by mentors from outside the country,” asked one political observer.
Do you think Yunus made a right decision to float a new political party?
Do you agree with the statements and fears expressed by various people?
How do you want this new party organised to make it different from other parties?
If you were the one to begin this political party how would you defend it?
Democracy Overview This concluding chapter draws upon all that you have learnt in the last two years so as to address the fundamental questions of democratic politics : What are the challenges that democracy faces in our country and elsewhere?
What can be done to reform democratic politics?
How can our democracy become more democratic in its practice and outcomes?
This chapter does not answer these questions.
It only makes some suggestions about the way in which we can approach the questions of challenges and reforms.
It invites you to think on your own and come up with your own reading of the challenges, your recipe of how to overcome these and your own definition of democracy.
Chapter 8 enges to Democracy Thinking about challenges Do you remember the first chapter of your Political Science textbook of Class IX?
There we tracked the expansion of democracy all over the world in the last hundred years.
Our reading thereafter has confirmed our initial impression: democracy is the dominant form of government in the contemporary world.
It does not face a serious challenger or rival.
Yet our exploration of the various dimensions of democratic politics has shown us something else as well.
The promise of democracy is far from realised anywhere in the world.
Democracy does not have a challenger, but that does not mean that it does not face any challenges.
At different points in this tour of democracy, we have noted the serious challenges that democracy faces all over the world.
A challenge is not just any problem.
We usually call only those difficulties a ‘challenge’ which are significant and which can be overcome.
A challenge is a difficulty that carries within it an opportunity for progress.
Once we overcome a challenge we go up to a higher level than before.
Different countries face different kinds of challenges.
Can you recall the map of democratic governments in the year 2000 that was included in your textbook?
At least one fourth of the globe is still not under democratic government.
The challenge for democracy in these parts of the world is very stark.
POLI{iCAL SCIENCE, These countries face the foundational challenge of making the transition to democracy and then instituting democratic government.
This involves bringing down the existing non-democratic regime, keeping military away from controlling government and establishing a sovereign and functional state.
Most of the established democracies face the challenge of expansion.
This involves applying the basic principle of democratic government across all the regions, different social groups and various institutions.
Ensuring greater power to local governments, extension of federal principle to all the units of the federation, inclusion of women and minority groups, etc., falls under this challenge.
This also means that less and less decisions should remain outside the arena of democratic control.
Most countries including India and other democracies like the US face this challenge.
The third challenge of deepening of democracy is faced by every democracy in one form or another.
This involves strengthening of the institutions and practices of democracy.
This should happen in such a way that people can realise their expectations of democracy.
But ordinary people have different expectations from democracy in different societies. Therefore, this challenge takes different meanings and paths in different parts of the world.
In general terms, it usually means strengthening those institutions that help people’s participation and control.
This requires an attempt to bring down the control and influence of the rich and powerful people in making governmental decision.
We have noted or hinted at these challenges in all the various examples and stories that we studied in our textbook of Class IX and in the earlier chapters of this book.
Let us go back to all the major stops in our tour of democracy, refresh our memory and note down the challenges that democracy faces in each of these.
Different contexts, different challenges Each of these cartoons represents a challenge to democracy.
Please describe what that challenge is.
Also place it in one of the three categories mentioned in the first section.

Think of all the challenges that democracy faces in contemporary India.
List those five that should be addressed first of all.

Give one example of that challenge and your reasons for assigning it the priority.
Priority | Challenges to Example Reasons for preference democracy Ke a a J) o>) Ll J) fo) J) a) fo) i J) o>) i J) Thinking about political reforms Each of these challenges is linked to the possibility of reforms.
As mentioned above, we discuss challenges only because we think these can be overcome.
Generally all the suggestions or proposals about overcoming various challenges to democracy are called ‘democracy reform’ or ‘political reform’.
We are not going to give here a list of desirable political reforms, for there cannot be any such list.
If all the countries do not have the same challenges, it follows that everyone cannot follow the same recipe of political reforms.
We cannot prescribe a procedure for cat repair without knowing which model the car is, what the defect is and what tools are available, where the car has broken down, etc.
Can we at least have a list of such reforms for our country in today’s context?
We can develop some proposals for reforms at the national level. But the real challenge of reforms may not lie at the national level.
Some of the crucial questions need to be thought at the State or local level.
Besides, such a list may become irrelevant after some time.
So, instead of that let us think of some broad guidelines that can be kept in mind while devising ways and means for political reforms in India: @ It is very tempting to think of legal ways of reforming politics, to think of new laws to ban undesirable things.
But this temptation needs to be resisted.
No doubt, law has an important role to play in political reform.
Carefully devised changes in law can help to discourage wrong political practices and encourage good ones.
But legal-constitutional changes by themselves cannot overcome challenges to democracy.
This is like the rules of cricket.
A change in rules for LBW decisions helped to reduce negative batting tactics. But no one would ever think that the quality of cricket could be improved mainly through changes in the rules.
This is to be done mainly by the players, coaches and administrators.
Similarly, democratic reforms ate to be carried out mainly by political activists, parties, movements and politically conscious citizens.
Sometimes the results may be counter-productive. For example, many states have banned people who have more than two children from contesting panchayat elections.
This has resulted in denial of democratic opportunity to many poor and women, which was not intended.
Generally, laws that seek to ban something are not very successful in politics.
Laws that give political actors incentives to do good things have more chances of working.
The best laws are those which empower people to carry out democratic reforms.
The Right to Information Act is a good example of a law that empowers the people to find out what is happening in government and act as watchdogs of democracy.
Such a law helps to control corruption and supplements the existing laws that banned corruption and imposed strict penalties.
@® Democratic reforms are to be brought about principally through political practice.
Therefore, the main focus of political reforms should be on ways to strengthen democratic practice.
As we discussed in the chapter on political parties, the most important concern should be to increase and improve the quality of political participation by ordinary citizens.
@ Any proposal for political reforms should think not only about what ts a good solution but also about who will implement it and how.
It is not very wise to think that the legislatures will pass legislations that go against the interest of all the political parties and MPs.
But measures that rely on democratic movements, citizens’ organisations and the media are likely to succeed.
Let us keep these general guidelines in mind and look at some specific instances of challenges to democracy that require some measure of reform.
Let us try to come up with some concrete proposals of reform.
Here are some challenges that require political reforms.
Discuss these challenges in detail study the reform options offered here and give your preferred solution with reasons.
Remember that none of the options offered here is ‘right’ or ‘wrong’.
You can opt for a mix of more than one options, or come up with something that is not offered here.
But you must give your solution in details and offer reasons for your choice.
#ERROR!
They live in.a town, catty out private practice and visit the village where they are posted only once or twice in the entire month.
Villagers have to travel to towns and pay very high fee to private doctors even for common ailments.
Reform proposals: ® The government should make it compulsory for the doctors to live in the village where they are posted, otherwise their service should be terminated.
® District administration and police should carry out surprise raids to check the attendance of the doctors.
®@ Village panchayat should be given the power to write the annual report of the doctor which should be read out in the gram sabha meeting.
@ Problems like this can be solved only if Uttar Pradesh is split into several smaller states which can be administered mote efficiently.
Any other problem of your choice Challenge: Reform proposals: Political funding Challenge: On an average, every candidate who contested the last Lok Sabha elections owned a property of more than Rs one crore.
There is a fear that only wealthy people or those with their support can afford to fight elections.
Most of the political parties are dependent on money given by big business houses.
The worty is that the role of money in politics will reduce whatever little voice the poor have in our democracy.
Reform proposals: @ The financial accounts of every political party should be made public.
These accounts should be examined by government auditors.
@ There should be state funding of elections.
® Citizens should be encouraged to give more donations to parties and to political workers.
Such donations should be exempt from income tax.
enges to Democracy Refo rming po iti CJAMS Rose managed to catch Madam Lyngdoh outside the classroom, something she had been planning to do for some time.
| really liked that Canadian cartoon”. Rose needed something to open the conversation.
“Which one?” Madam Lyngdoh could not recall.
“Ma’am, the one which says 98% Canadians want all the politicians to be locked in the trunk of a car and thrown into Niagara falls.
| was thinking of our politicians.
We would need a bigger vehicle and ariver as mighty as Brahm aputra!” Lyngdoh Ma’am smiled at Rose.
Like most Indians, she is also very much unhappy with the way politicians of the country have been behaving and running the parties and governments.
But she wanted Rose to appreciate the complexity of the problem: “Do you think our problems will be solved if we get rid of our politicians?,” she asked.
“Yes, Ma’am. Aren’t these mean politicians responsible for all the problems in our country?
| mean corruption, defection, casteism, communal violence, criminality...everything.” Lyngdoh Madam: “So, all we need is to get rid of the current lot.
Are you sure that those who replace them will not do these things?” Rose: “Well, | had not thought of it, but may be not.
May be we will get leaders of better character”.
Lyngdoh Madam: “I agree with you that the situation will change if people show more care and alertness to reject corrupt and bad politicians and elect the right ones. And, maybe, all politicians are not corrupt..?
“How can you say that Ma’am” interrupted Rose.
Lyngdoh Madam: “I did not say that politicians are not corrupt.
Maybe when you think of politicians you think of these big people whose photos appear in newspapers. | think of political leaders that | have known.
| don’t think that the political leaders | know are more corrupt than my own colleagues, government officials, contractors or other middle class professionals that | know.
The corruption of the politician is more visible and we get the impression that all politicians are corrupt.
Some of them are and some of them are not.” Rose did not give up.
“Ma’am, what | meant is that there should be strict laws to curb corruption and wrong practices like appeals to caste and community. Lyngdoh Madam: “I am not sure Rose.
For one thing there is already a law banning any appeal to caste and religion in politics. Politicians find a way to bypass that.
Laws can have little impact unless people resist attempts to mislead and divide people in the name of caste and religion.
You cannot have democracy in a real sense unless people and politicians overcome the barriers of caste and religion.
Redefining democracy We began this tour of democracy last year with a minimal definition of democracy.
Do you remember that?
This is what Chapter 2 of your textbook said last year: democracy is a form of government in which the rulers are elected by the people.
We then looked at many cases and expanded the definition slightly to add some qualifications: ® the rulers elected by the people must take all the major decisions; @ elections must offer a choice and fair opportunity to the people to change the current rulers; @ this choice and opportunity should be available to all the people on an equal basis; and @ the exercise of this choice must lead to a government limited by basic rules of the constitution and citizens’ rights.
You may have felt disappointed that the definition did not refer to any high ideals that we associate with democracy.
But in operational terms, we deliberately started with a minimalist but clear definition of democracy.
It allowed us to make a clear distinction between democratic and non-democratic regimes.
You may have noticed that in the course of our discussions of various aspects of democratic government and politics, we have gone beyond that definition: @ Wediscussed democratic rights at length and noted that these rights are not limited to the right to vote, stand in elections and form political organisations.
We discussed some social and economic rights that a democracy should offer to its citizens.
@ We have taken up power sharing as the spirit of democracy and discussed how power sharing between governments and social groups is necessary in a democracy.
@® Wesaw how democracy cannot be the brute rule of majority and how a respect for minority voice is necessary for democracy.
@ Our discussion of democracy has gone beyond the government and its activities.
We discussed how eliminating discrimination based on caste, religion and gender is important in a democracy.
@ Finally, we have had some discussion about some outcomes that one can expect from a democracy.
In doing so, we have not gone against the definition of democracy offered last year.
We began then with a definition of what is the minimum a country must have to be called a democracy.
In the course of our discussion we moved to the set of desirable conditions that a democracy should have.
We have moved from the definition of democracy to the description of a good democracy.
How do we define a good democracy?
What are its features?
And what must not take place in a democracy if it is a good democracy?
You decide that.

Try to compress it in as few points as possible) How did you like this exercise?
Was it enjoyable?
A little frustrating? And a little scary?
Are you a little resentful that the textbook did not help you in this crucial task?
Are you worried that your definition may not be ‘correct’?
Here then is your last lesson in thinking about democracy: there is no fixed definition of good democracy.
A good democracy is what we think it is and what we wish to make it. This may sound strange.
Yet, think of it: is it democratic for someone to dictate to us what a good democracy is?
CONSIHUTIO N: WHY AND HOW?
INTRODUCTION This book,is about the working of the Indian Constitution.
In the chapters that follow, you will read information about various aspects of the working of our Constitution.
You will learn about the various institutions of the government in our country and their relationship with each other.
But before you begin to read about elections, governments, and presidents and prime ministers, it is necessary to understand that the entire structure of the government and the various principles that bind the institutions of government have their origin in the Constitution of India.
After studying this chapter, you will learn: what a constitution means; what a constitution does to the society; how constitutions govern the allocation of power in society; and what was the way in which the Constitution of India was made.
©o¢ & Indian Constitution at Work Way Do WE NEED a ConsTITUTION?
What is a constitution?
What role does it perform for a society?
How does a constitution relate to our daily existence?
Answering these questions is not as difficult as you might think.
Constitution allows coordination and assurance Imagine yourself to be a member of a reasonably large group.
Further imagine that this group has the following characteristics. The members of this group are diverse in various ways.
They have different religious allegiances: some are Hindus, some are Muslims, some Christians and some perhaps profess no religion at all.
in many different respects: they pursue different professions, have different abilities, have different hobbies, different tastes in everything from films to books.
fis group is very much Some are rich and some are poor.
fike the people of my Some are old, some young.
Imagine further that members of this group are likely to have disputes over various aspects of life: How much property should one_be allowed to own?
Should it be compulsory that every child be sent to school or should the parents be allowed to decide?
How much should this group spend on its safety and security?
Or should it build more parks instead?
Should the group be allowed to discriminate against some of its members?
Every question will elicit a variety of answers from different people.
But, for all their diversity, this group has to live together.
They are dependent upon each other in various ways.
They 2 require the cooperation of each other.
What will enable the group to live together peacefully?
One may say that perhaps members of this group can live together if they can agree on some basic rules.
Why will the group need certain basic rules?
Think of what would happen in the absence of some basic rules.
Every individual would be insecure simply because they would not know what members of this group could do to each other, who could claim rights over what.
Any group will need some basic rules that are publicly promulgated and known to all members of that group to achieve a minimal degree of coordination.
But these rules must not only be known, they must also be enforceable.
If citizens have no assurance that others will follow these rules, they will themselves have no reason to follow these rules.
Saying that the rules are legally enforceable gives an assurance to everybody that others will follow these, for ifthey do not do so, they will be punished.
The first function of a constitution is to provide a set of basic rules that allow for minimal coordination amongst members of a society.
Activity Enact the thought experiment of this section in the classroom.
The entire class should discuss and arrive at some decisions that would apply to everyone for this entire session.
The decision could be about: © How would the class representatives be chosen?
© Which decisions will the representative be able to take on behalf of the entire class?
Are there some decisions that the class representative cannot take without consulting the entire class?
© You can add any other items to this list (collection of common kitty for the class, organisation of picnic and trips, sharing of common resources, ...) as long as everyone agrees to it.
Make sure that you include those subjects that have led to any differences in the past.
© How to revise these decisions in case you need to?
Indian Constitution at Work © Write down all these decisions on a paper and put it up on the notice board.
Which problems did you encounter in this decision?
Were there differences among different students?
How did you resolve these differences?
Did the entire class gain something from this exercise?
Specification of decision making powers Aconstitution is a body of fundamental principles according to which a state is constituted or governed.
But what should these fundamental rules be?
And what makes them fundamental?
Well, the first question you will have to decide is who gets to decide what the laws governing the society should be?
You may want rule X, but others may want rule Y.
How do we decide whose rules or preferences should govern us?
You may think the rules you want everyone to live by are the best; but others think that their rules are the best.
How do we resolve this dispute?
So even before you decide what rules should govern this group you have to decide: Who gets to decide?
The constitution has to provide an answer to this question.
It specifies the basic allocation of power in a society.
It decides who gets to decide what the laws will be.
In principle, this question, who gets to decide, can be answered in many ways: in a monarchical constitution, a monarch decides; in some constitutions like the old Soviet Union, one single party was given the power to decide.
But in democratic constitutions, broadly speaking, the people get to decide.
But this matter is not so simple.
Because even if you answer that the people should decide, it will not answer the question: how should the people decide?
For something to be law, should everyone agree to it?
Should the people directly vote on each matter as the ancient Greeks did?
Or should the people express their preferences by electing representatives?
But if the people act through their representatives, how should these representatives be elected?
How many should there be?
In the Indian Constitution for example, it is specified that in most instances, Parliament gets to decide laws and policies, and that Parliament itself be organised in a particular manner.
Before identifying what the law in any given society is, you have to identify Chapter 1: Constitution: Why and How?
If Parliament has the authority to enact laws, there must be a law that bestows this authority on Parliament in the first place.
This is the function of the constitution.
It is an authority that constitutes government in the first place.
The second function of a constitution is to specify who has the power to make decisions in a society.
It decides how the government will be constituted.
Limitations on the powers of government But this is clearly not enough.
Does this always happen in any constitution making? were not free to sing certain songs or that people who belonged to a particular group (caste or religion) would always have to serve others and would not be allowed to retain any property.
Or that government could arbitrarily arrest someone, or that only people of a certain skin colour would be allowed to draw water from wells.
You would obviously think these laws were unjust and unfair.
Indian Constitution at Work on certain procedures there would be something obviously unjust about that government enacting these laws. So the third function of a constitution is to set some limits on what a government can impose on its citizens.
These limits are fundamental in the sense that government may never trespass them.
Constitutions limit the power of government in many ways.
The most common way of limiting the power of government is to specify certain fundamental rights that all of us possess as citizens and which no government can ever be allowed to violate.
The exact content and interpretation of these rights varies from constitution to constitution.
But most constitutions will protect a basic cluster of rights.
Citizens will be protected from being arrested arbitrarily and for no reason.
This is one basic limitation upon the power of government.
Citizens will normally have the right to some basic liberties: to freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of association, freedom to conduct a trade or business etc.
In practice, these rights can be limited during times of national emergency and the constitution specifies the circumstances under which these rights may be withdrawn.
Aspirations and goals of a society Most of the older constitutions limited themselves largely to allocating decision-making power and setting some limits to government power.
But many twentieth century constitutions, of which the Indian Constitution is the finest example, also provide an enabling framework for the government to do certain positive things, to express the aspirations and goals of society.
The Indian Constitution was particularly innovative in this respect.
Societies with deep entrenched inequalities of various kinds, will not only have to set limits on the power of government, they will also have to enable and empower the government to take positive measures to overcome forms of inequality or deprivation.
For example, India aspires to be a society that is free of caste discrimination.
If this is our society’s aspiration, the government will have to be enabled or empowered to take all the necessary steps to achieve this goal.
In a country like South Africa, which had a deep history of racial discrimination, its new constitution had to enable the government to end racial discrimination.
More positively, a Reap A CARTOON The constitution makers have to address themselves to very different aspirations.
Here is Nehru trying to balance between different visions and ideologies.
Can you identify what these different groups stand for?
Who do you think prevailed in this balancing act?
The framers of the Indian Constitution, for example, thought that each individual in society should have all that is necessary for them to lead a life of minimal dignity and social self-respect — minimum material well being, education etc.
The Indian Constitution enables the government to take positive welfare measures some of which are legally enforceable.
What does it take to write nice things in the constitution?
What is the point in writing down lofty aspirations and goals if they cannot change the life of the people?
The Directive Principles of State of Policy also enjoin government to fulfil certain aspirations of the people. The fourth function of a constitution is to enable the government to fulfil the aspirations of a society and create conditions for a just society.
Enabling provisions of the Constitution Constitutions are not only rules and regulations controlling the powers of the government.
They also give powers to the government for pursuing collective good of the society.
© Constitution of South Africa assigns many responsibilities to the government: it wants the government to take measures to promote conservation of nature, make efforts to protect persons or groups subjected to unfair discrimination, and provides that the government must progressively ensure adequate housing to all, health care, etc.
© In the case of Indonesia also, the government is enjoined to establish and conduct national education system.
The Indonesian Constitution ensures that the poor and destitute children will be looked after by the government.
Fundamental identity of a people Finally, and perhaps even most importantly, a constitution expresses the fundamental identity of a people.
This means the people as a collective entity come into being only through the basic constitution.
It is by agreeing to a basic set of norms about how one should be governed, and who should be governed that one forms a collective identity.
One has many sets of identities that exist prior to a constitution.
agreeing to certain basic norms and principles one constitutes one’s basic political identity.
Second, constitutional norms are the overarching framework within which one pursues individual aspirations, goals and freedoms.
The constitution sets authoritative constraints upon what one may or may not do.
So the constitution also gives one a moral identity.
Third and finally, it may be the case that many basic political and moral values are now shared across different constitutional traditions.
If one looks at constitutions around the world, they differ in many respects — in the form of government they enjoin in many procedural details.
But they also share a good deal.
Most modern constitutions create a form of government that is democratic in some respects, most claim to protect certain basic rights.
But constitutions are different in the way they embody conceptions of natural identity.
Most nations are an amalgamation of a complex set of historical traditions; they weave together the diverse groups that reside within the nation in different ways.
For example, German identity was constituted by being ethnically German.
The constitution gave expression to this identity.
The Indian Constitution, on the other hand, does not make ethnic identity a criterion for citizenship.
Different nations embody different conceptions of what the _ relationship Reap A CARTOON 1 |» ५५" r ww) a) ® 22000 मदद Ge is ४६ ४४४० / Wan We ‘ ee Sak yy) 8) Pes oe है जा in) The writing of the new Iraqi constitution after the collapse of Saddam Hussain’s regime saw a lot of conflict between different ethnic groups in the country.

Indian Constitution at Work between the different regions of a nation and the central government should be. This relationship constitutes the national identity of a country.
Check your progress Here are some provisions of the Indian and other constitutions.
For each of these write the function that this provision performs.
The government cannot Limitations on the order any citizen to follow power of the or not to follow any religion government The government must try to reduce inequalities in income and wealth The President has the power to appoint the Prime Minister The Constitution is the supreme law that everyone has to obey Indian citizenship is not limited to people of any race, caste or religion THE AUTHORITY OF A CONSTITUTION We have outlined some of the functions a constitution performs.
These functions explain why most societies have a constitution.
But there are three further questions we can ask about constitutions: Chapter 1: Constitution: Why and How? a) Whatis a constitution?
b) How effective is a constitution?
c) Is a constitution just?
In most countries, ‘Constitution’ is a compact document that comprises a number of articles about the state, specifying how the state is to be constituted and what norms it should follow.
When we ask for the constitution of a country we are usually referring to this document.
But some countries, the United Kingdom for instance, do not have one single document that can be called the Constitution. Rather they have a series of documents and decisions that, taken collectively, are referred to as the constitution.
So, we can say that constitution is the document or set of documents that seeks to perform the functions that we mentioned above.
But many constitutions around the world exist only on paper; they are mere words existing on a parchment.
The crucial question is: how effective is a constitution?
What makes it effective?
What ensures that it has a real impact on the lives of people?
Making a constitution effective depends upon many factors.
Mode of promulgation This refers to how a constitution comes into being. Who crafted the constitution and how much authority did they have?
In many countries constitutions remain defunct because they are crafted by military leaders or leaders who are not popular and do not have the ability to carry the people with them.
The most successful constitutions, like India, South Africa and the United States, are constitutions which were created in the aftermath of popular national movements.
Although India’s Constitution was formally created by a Constituent Assembly between December 1946 and November 1949, it drew upon a long history of the nationalist movement that had a remarkable ability to take along different sections of Indian society together.
fact that it was drawn up by people who enjoyed immense public credibility, who had the capacity to negotiate and command the respect of a wide cross-section of society, and who were able to convince the people that the constitution was not an instrument for the aggrandisement of their personal power.
The final document reflected the broad national consensus at the time.
Some countries have subjected their constitution to a full-fledged referendum, where all the people vote on the desirability of a constitution.
The Indian Constitution was never subject to such a_referendum, but nevertheless carried enormous public authority, because it had the consensus and backing of leaders who were themselves popular.
Although the Constitution itself was not subjected to a referendum, the people adopted it as their own by abiding by its provisions.
Therefore, the authority of people who enact the constitution helps determine in part its prospects for success.
The substantive provisions ofa constitution It is the hallmark of a successful constitution that it gives everyone in society some reason to go along with its provisions.
Nepal is an example of the complicated nature of constitution making.
Since 1948, Nepal has had five constitutions, in 1948, 1951, 1959, 1962 and 1990.
But all these constitutions were ‘granted’ by the King of Nepal.
The 1990 constitution introduced a multi- party competition, though the King continued to hold final powers in many respects.
For the last ten years Nepal was faced with militant political agitations for restructuring the government of the country.
The main issue was the role of the monarchy in the constitution of Nepal.
Some groups in Nepal wanted to abolish the institution of monarchy and establish republican form of government in Nepal.
Others believed that it may be useful to shift to limited monarchy with a reduced role for the King.
The King himself was not ready to give up powers.
He took over all powers in October 2002.
Many political parties and organisations were demanding the formation of a new constituent assembly.
The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) was in the forefront of the struggle for a popularly elected constituent assembly.
Finally, under pressure of popular agitation, the King had to instal a government acceptable to the agitating parties.
This government has stripped the King of almost all powers.
Now, all the parties are trying to decide the manner in which a constituent assembly will be formed.
But it has to convince people that it provides the framework for pursuing basic justice.
Do this thought experiment.
Ask yourself this question: What would be the content of some basic rules in society, such that they gave everyone a reason to go along with them?
The more a constitution preserves the freedom and equality of all its members, the more likely it is to succeed.
Does the Indian Constitution, broadly speaking, give everyone a reason to go along with its broad outlines?
After studying this book, one should be able to answer this question in the affirmative.
Balanced institutional design Constitutions are often subverted, not by the people, but by small groups, who wish to enhance their own power.
Well crafted constitutions fragment power in society intelligently so that no single group can subvert the constitution.
One way of such intelligent designing of a constitution is to ensure that no single institution acquires monopoly of power.
This is often done by fragmenting power across different institutions.
The Indian Constitution, for example, horizontally fragments power across different institutions like the Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary and even independent statutory bodies like the Election Commission.
This ensures that even if one institution wants to subvert the Constitution, others can check its transgressions.
An intelligent system of checks and balances has facilitated the success of the Indian Constitution.
Another important aspect of intelligent institutional design is: that a constitution must strike the right balance between certain values, norms and procedures as authoritative, and at the same time allow enough flexibility in its operations to adapt to changing needs and circumstances.
Too rigid a constitution is likely to break under the weight of change; a constitution that is, on the other , Ares, copyright Cagle Cartoons, SEPO5 “Castle of Cards” Reap A CARTOON Why does the cartoonist describe the new Iraqi Constitution as the castle of cards?
Would this description apply to the Indian Constitution?
Indian Constitution at Work hand, too flexible, will give no security, predictability or identity to a people.
Successful constitutions strike the right balance between preserving core values and adapting them to new circumstances.
You will notice the wisdom of makers of the Indian Constitution in the chapter on the Constitution as a living document (Chapter 9). The Indian Constitution is described as ‘a living’ document.
By striking a balance between the possibility to change the provisions and the limits on such changes, the Constitution has ensured that it will survive as a document respected by people.
This arrangement also ensures that no section or group can, on its own, subvert the Constitution.
Therefore in determining whether a constitution has authority you can ask yourself three questions: © Were the people who enacted the constitution credible?
This question will be answered in the remaining part of this chapter.
© Secondly, did the constitution ensure that power was intelligently organised so that it was not easy for any group to subvert the constitution?
And, most importantly, does the constitution give everyone some reason to go along with it?
Most of this book is about this question.
© Also, is the constitution the locus of people’s hopes and aspiration?
The ability of the constitution to command voluntary allegiance of the people depends to a certain extent upon whether the constitution is just.
14 How was the Indian Constitution made?
Formally, the Constitution was made by the Constituent Assembly which had been elected for undivided India.
It held its first sitting on Chapter 1: Constitution: Why and How? 9 December1946 and re-assembled as Constituent Assembly for divided India on 14 August 1947.
Its members were elected by indirect election by the members of the Provisional Legislative Assemblies that had been established in 1935.
The Constituent Assembly was composed roughly along the lines suggested by the plan proposed by the committee of the British cabinet, known as the Cabinet Mission.
According to this plan: © Each Province and each Princely State or group of States were allotted seats proportional to their respective population roughly in the ratio of 1:10,00,000.
As a result the Provinces (that were under direct British rule) were to elect 292 members while the Princely States were allotted a minimum of 93 seats.
© The seats in each Province were distributed among the three main communities, Muslims, Sikhs and general, in proportion to their respective populations.
© Members of each community in the Provisional Legislative Assembly elected their own representatives by the method of proportional representation with single transferable vote.
© The method of selection in the case of representatives of Princely States was to be determined by consultation.

I, p.6 article of faith in almost all the ically-minded classes in the try.” What would have happened if the Constituent Assembly was elected by all the people of India?
Could it be very different from what it was?
Composition of the Constituent Assembly As a consequence of the Partition under the plan of 3 June 1947 those members who were elected from territories which fell under Pakistan ceased to be members of the Constituent Assembly.
The numbers in the Assembly were reduced to 299 of which 284 were actually present on 26 November 1949 and appended their signature to the Constitution as finally passed.
The Constitution was thus framed against the backdrop of the horrendous violence that the Partition unleashed on the sub-continent.
But it is a tribute to the fortitude of the framers that they were not only able to draft a constitution under immense pressure, but also learnt the right lessons from the unimaginable violence that accompanied Partition.
The Constitution was committed to anew conception of citizenship, where not only would minorities be secure, but religious identity would have no bearing on citizenship rights.
But this account of the composition of the Constituent Assembly that drafted the Constitution touches upon only the surface of how our Constitution was made.
Although, the members of the Assembly were not elected by universal suffrage, there was a serious attempt to make the Assembly a representative body.
Members of all religions were given representation under the scheme described above; in addition, the Assembly had twenty- six members from what were then known as the Scheduled Classes.
In terms of political parties, the Congress dominated the Assembly occupying as many as eighty-two per cent of the seats in the assembly after the Partition.
The Congress itself was such a diverse party that it managed to accommodate almost all shades of opinion within it.
The Principle of Deliberation The authority of the Constituent Assembly does not come only from the fact that it was broadly, though not perfectly, representative.
It comes from the procedures it adopted to frame the Constitution and the values its members brought to their deliberations.
While in any assembly that claims to be representative, it is desirable that diverse sections of society participate, it is equally important that they participate not only as representatives of their own identity or community.
Each member deliberated upon the Constitution with the interests of the whole nation in mind.
There were often disagreements amongst members, but few of these disagreements could be traced to members protecting their own interests.
There were legitimate differences of principle. And the differences were many: should India adopt a centralised or decentralised system of government?
What should be the relations between the States and the centre?
What should be the powers of the judiciary?
Should the Constitution protect property rights?
Almost every issue that lies at the foundation of a modern state was discussed with great sophistication.
Only one provision of the Constitution was passed without virtually any debate: the introduction of universal suffrage (meaning that all citizens reaching a certain age, would be entitled to be voters irrespective of religion, caste, education, gender or income).
So, while the members felt no need at all to discuss the issue of who should have the right to vote, every other matter was seriously discussed and debated.
Nothing can be a better testament to the democratic commitment of this Assembly.
The Constitution drew its authority from the fact that members of the Constituent Assembly engaged in what one might call public reason.
The members of the Assembly placed a great emphasis on discussion and reasoned argument.
They did not simply advance their own interests, but gave principled reasons to other members for their positions.
The voluminous debates in the Shankar.
Copyright: Children’s Book Trust Indian Constitution at Work Constituent Assembly, where each clause of the Constitution was subjected to scrutiny and debate, is a tribute to public reason at its best.
These debates deserved to be memorialised as one of the most significant chapters in the history of constitution making, equal in importance to the French and American revolutions.
Procedures The importance of public reason was emphasised in the mundane procedures of the Assembly as well.
The Constituent Assembly had eight major Committees on different subjects.
Usually, Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad or Ambedkar chaired these Committees.
These were not men who agreed with each other on many things.
Ambedkar had been a bitter critic of the Congress and Gandhi, accusing them of not doing enough for the upliftment of Scheduled Castes.
Patel and Nehru disagreed on many issues.
Nevertheless, they all worked together.
Each Committee usually drafted particular provisions of the Constitution which were then subjected to debate by the entire Assembly.
Usually an attempt was made to reach a consensus with the belief that provisions agreed to by all, would not be detrimental to any particular interests.
Some provisions were subject to the vote.
But in each instance every single argument, query or concern was responded to with great care and Chapter 1: Constitution: Why and How?
in writing.
The Assembly met for one hundred and sixty six days, spread over two years and eleven months.
Its sessions were open to the press and the public alike.
Inheritance of the nationalist movement But no constitution is simply a product of the Assembly that produces it.
An Assembly as diverse as the Constituent Assembly of India could not have functioned if there was no background consensus on the main principles the Constitution should enshrine.
These principles were forged during the long struggle for freedom.
In a way, the Constituent Assembly was giving concrete shape and form to the principles it had inherited from the nationalist movement.
For decades preceding the promulgation of the Constitution, the nationalist movement had debated many questions that were relevant to the making of the constitution — the shape and form of government India should have, the values it should uphold, the inequalities it should overcome.
Answers forged in those debates were given their final form in the Constitution.
Perhaps the best summary of the principles that the nationalist movement brought to the Constituent Assembly is the Objectives Resolution (the resolution that defined the aims of the Assembly) moved by Nehru in 1946.
This resolution encapsulated the aspirations and values behind the Constitution.
What the previous section terms as substantive provisions of the constitution is inspired by and summed up by the values incorporated in the Objectives Resolution.
Based on this resolution, our Constitution gave institutional expression to these fundamental commitments: equality, liberty, democracy, sovereignty and a cosmopolitan identity.
Thus, our Constitution is not merely a maze ofrules and procedures, but a moral commitment to establish a government that will fulfil the many promises that the nationalist movement held before the people.
Institutional arrangements The third factor ensuring effectiveness of a constitution is a balanced arrangement of the institutions of government.
The basic principle is that government must be democratic and committed to the welfare of the people.
The Constituent Assembly spent a lot of time on evolving the right balance among the various institutions like the executive, the legislature and the judiciary.
This led to the adoption of the parliamentary form and the federal arrangement, which would distribute governmental powers between the Chapter 1: Constitution: Why and How?
legislature and the executive on the one hand and between the States and the central government on the other hand.
While evolving the most balanced governmental arrangements, the makers of our Constitution did not hesitate to learn from experiments and experiences of other countries.
Thus, the framers of the Constitution were not averse to borrowing from other constitutional traditions.
Indeed, it is a testament to their wide learning that they could lay their hands upon any intellectual argument, or historical example that was necessary for fulfilling the task at hand.
So they borrowed a number of provisions from different countries.
But borrowing these ideas was not slavish imitation. Far from it.
Each provision of the Constitution had to be defended on grounds that it was suited to Indian problems and aspirations.
India was extremely lucky to have an Assembly that instead of being parochial in its outlook could take the best available everywhere in the world and make it their own.

The only new thing, if e can be any, in a constitution ed so late in the day are the ations, made to remove the res and accommodate it to the s of the country.” Was it a borrowed constitution then?
Why could we not have a constitution that does not borrow anything from anywhere else?

Conclusion It is a tribute to the wisdom and foresight of the makers of the Constitution that they presented to the nation a document that enshrined fundamental values and highest aspirations shared by the people.
This is one of the reasons why this most intricately crafted document has not only survived but become a living reality, when so many other constitutions have perished with the paper they were first written on.
India’s Constitution is a unique document which in turn became an exemplar for many other constitutions, most notably South Africa.
The main purpose behind the long search that went on for almost three years was to strike the right balance so that institutions created by the Constitution would not be haphazard or tentative arrangements but would be able to accommodate the aspirations of the people of India for a long time to come.
You will know more about these arrangements through the study of the remaining chapters in this book.

Do you agree with any of these positions? If yes, why?
If not, what is your own position?
As we studied in the last chapter, the constitution is a document that sets limits on the powers of the government and ensures a democratic system in which all persons enjoy certain rights.
In this chapter, we shall study the Fundamental Rights contained in the Indian Constitution.
Part three of the Constitution of India lists the Fundamental Rights and also mentions the limits on these rights.
In the past fifty years, the scope of rights has changed and in some respects, expanded.
After studying this chapter, you would know © what are the various Fundamental Rights listed in the Constitution of India; © how these rights are protected; © what role the judiciary has played in protecting and interpreting these rights; and © what is the difference between the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy.
Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution THE IMPORTANCE OF RIGHTS In 1982 during the construction work for Asian Games the government engaged a few contractors.
These contractors employed a large number of very poor construction workers from different parts of the country to build the flyovers and stadiums.
These workers were kept in poor working conditions and were paid less than the minimum wages decided by the government.
A team of social scientists studied their poor condition and petitioned the Supreme Court.
They argued that employing a person to work for less than the minimum prescribed wage amounts to begar or forced labour, which is a violation of the Fundamental Right against exploitation.
The court accepted this plea and directed the government to ensure that thousands of workers get the prescribed wages for their work.
Machal Lalung was 23 when he was arrested.
A resident of Chuburi village of Morigaon district of Assam, Machal was charged of causing grievous injuries.
He was found mentally too unstable to stand trial and was sent as under trial to Lok Priya Gopinath Bordoloi Mental Hospital in Tejpur for treatment.
Machal was treated successfully and doctors wrote twice to jail authorities in 1967 and 1996 that he was fit to stand trial.
But no one paid any attention.
Machal Lalung remained in “judicial custody.” Machal Lalung was released inJuly 2005.
He was 77 then.
He spent 54 years under custody during which his case never came up for hearing.
He was freed when a team appointed by the National Human Rights Commission intervened after an inspection of undertrials in the State.
Machal’s entire life was wasted because a proper trial against him never took place.
Our Constitution gives every citizen the right to ‘life and liberty’: this means that every citizen must also have the right to fair and speedy trial.
I get it! The bill of rights is fike a warrantee card that we get when we purchase a TV or a fan. Isn’t it?
a Indian Constitution at Work In the case of the first instance also there was violation of rights provided in the Constitution.
But it was challenged in the court.
As a result, workers could get what was due to them in the form of their rightful wages. The constitutional guarantee of the right against exploitation ensured justice to these workers.
Bill of Rights Both these examples show the importance of having rights and of the actual implementation of these rights.
Therefore it is often a practice in most democratic countries to list the rights of the citizens in the constitution itself.
Such a list of rights mentioned and protected by the constitution is called the ‘bill of rights’.
A bill of rights prohibits government from thus acting against the rights of the individuals and ensures a remedy in case there is violation of these rights.
From whom does a constitution protect the rights of the individual?
The rights of a person may be threatened by another person or private organisation.
In such a situation, the individual would need the protection of the government.
So, it is necessary that the government is bound to protect the rights of the individual.
On the other hand, the organs of the government (the legislature, executive, bureaucracy or even the judiciary), in the course of their functioning, may violate the rights of the person.
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN THE INDIAN CoNSTITUTION During our freedom struggle, the leaders of the freedom movement had realised the importance of rights and demanded that the British rulers should respect rights of the people.
The Motilal Nehru committee had demanded a bill of rights as far back as in 1928.
It was therefore, natural that when India became independent and the Constitution was being prepared, there were no Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution two opinions on the inclusion and protection of rights in the Constitution.
The Constitution listed the rights that would be specially protected and called them ‘fundamental rights’.
The word fundamental suggests that these rights are so important that the Constitution has separately listed them and made special provisions for their protection.
The Fundamental Rights are so important that the Constitution itself ensures that they are not violated by the government.
Fundamental Rights are different from other rights available to us.
While ordinary legal rights are protected and enforced by ordinary law, Fundamental Rights are protected and guaranteed by the constitution of the country.
Ordinary rights may be changed by the legislature by ordinary process of law making, but a fundamental right may only be changed by amending the Constitution itself.
Besides this, no organ of the government can act in a manner that violates them.
As we shall study below in this chapter, judiciary has the powers and responsibility to protect the fundamental rights from violations by actions of the Bill of rights in the South African Constitution The South African Constitution was inaugurated in December 1996.
Its creation and promulgation took place at a time when South Africa still faced the threat of a civil war after the dissolution of the Apartheid government.
The South African Constitution says that its “Bill of Rights is a cornerstone of democracy in South Africa”.
It forbids discrimination on the grounds of “race, gender, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth”.
It grants perhaps the most extensive range of rights to the citizens.
A special constitutional court enforces the rights enshrined in the constitution.
Some of the Rights included in the constitution of South Africa include: Right to Dignity Right to Privacy Right to fair labour practices Right to healthy environment and right to protection of environment Right to adequate housing Right to health care, food, water and social security Children’s rights Right to basic and higher education Right of cultural, religious and linguistic communities Right to information oOo OO © © $9 9 Indian Constitution at Work government.
Executive as well as legislative actions can be declared illegal by the judiciary if these violate the fundamental rights or restrict them in an unreasonable manner.
However, fundamental rights are not absolute or unlimited rights.
Government can put reasonable restrictions on the exercise of our fundamental rights.

Or are these purely imaginary?
Indian Constitution at Work These are examples of clear discrimination.
In one instance the discrimination is based on caste and in another it is based on gender.
Do you think that such discrimination is justified?
Right to equality tries to do away with such and other discriminations.
It provides for equal access to public places like shops, hotels, places of entertainment, wells, bathing ghats and places of worship.
There cannot be any discrimination in this access on the basis of caste, creed, colour, sex, religion, or place of birth.
It also prohibits any discrimination in public employment on any of the above mentioned basis.
This right is very important because our society did not practice equal access in the past.
The practice of untouchability is one of the crudest manifestations of inequality.
This has been abolished under the right to equality. The same right also provides that the state shall confer no title on a person except those who excel themselves in military or academic field.
Thus right to equality strives to make India a true democracy by ensuring a sense of equality of dignity and status among allits citizens.
Have you read the Preamble to our Constitution?
How does it describe equality?
You will find that the Preamble mentions two things about equality: equality Article 16 (4): Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State. Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution of status and equality of opportunity.
Equality of opportunity means that all sections of the society enjoy equal opportunities.
But in a society where there are various kinds of social inequalities, what does equal opportunity mean?
The Constitution clarifies that the government can implement special schemes and measures for improving the conditions of certain sections of society: children, women, and the socially and educationally backward classes.
You may have heard about ‘reservations’ in jobs, and in admissions.
You would have wondered why there are reservations if we follow the principle of equality.
In fact Article 16(4) of the constitution explicitly clarifies that a policy like reservation will not be seen as a violation of right to equality.
If you see the spirit of the Constitution, this is required for the fulfilment of the right to equality of opportunity.
YOU ARE THE JUDGE You have received a post card from Hadibandhu, who identifies himself as a “member of the dalit community” in Puri district in Orissa.
Men from this community refused to follow a custom that required them to wash the feet of the groom and guests of the ‘upper caste’ during marriage ceremonies.
In revenge, four women from this community were beaten up and another was paraded naked.
The post card writer says “Our children are educated and they are not willing to do the customary job of washing the feet of upper caste men, clear the left-overs after the marriage feast and wash the utensils.” Assuming that the facts given above are correct, you have to decide: Does this case involve violation of Fundamental Rights?
What would you order the government to do in this case?
Does it mean that in some cases someone’s life can be taken away by law?
That sounds strange.
Can you think, of an example? Indian Constitution at Work Article 21: Protection of life and personal liberty—No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. RIGHT TO FREEDOM Equality and freedom or liberty, are the two rights that are most essential to a democracy.
It is not possible to think of the one without thinking of the other.
Liberty means freedom of thought, expression and action.
However it does not mean freedom to do anything that one desires or likes.
If that were to be permitted then a large number of people will not be able to enjoy their freedom.
Therefore, freedoms are defined in such a manner that every person will enjoy her freedom without threatening freedom of others and without endangering the law and order situation.
Right to life and personal liberty The foremost right among rights to freedom is the right to life and personal liberty.
No citizen can be denied his or her life except by procedure as laid down under the law.
That means no one can be arrested without being told the grounds for such an arrest.
If arrested, the person has the right to defend himself by a lawyer of his choice.
Also, it is mandatory for the police to take that person to the nearest magistrate within 24 hours.
The magistrate, who is not part of the police, will decide whether the arrest is justified or not.
This right is not just confined to a guarantee against taking away of an individual’s life but has wider application.
Various judgments of Supreme Court have expanded the scope of this right.
The Supreme Court Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution has ruled that this right also includes right to live with human dignity, free from exploitation.
The court has held that right to shelter and livelihood is also included in the right to life because no person can live without the means of living, that is, the means of livelihood.
However there are exceptions to this.
Sometimes a person can be arrested simply out of an apprehension that he or she is likely to engage in unlawful activity and imprisoned for some time without following the above mentioned procedure.
This is known as preventive detention.
It means that if the government feels that a person can be a threat to law and order or to the peace and security of the nation, it can detain or arrest that person.
This preventive detention can be extended only for three months.
After three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.
On the face of it, preventive detention looks like an effective tool in the hands of the government to deal with anti-social elements or subversives.
But this provision has often been misused by the government.
Many people think that there must be greater safeguards in this law so that it may not be misused against people for reasons other than that which are really justified.
In fact, there is a clear tension between right to life and personal liberty and the provision for preventive detention.
Other freedoms You can see that under the right to freedom there are some other rights as well.
These rights however are not absolute.
Each of these is subject to restrictions imposed by the government.
For example right to freedom of speech and expression is subject to restrictions such as public order, peace and morality etc.
Freedom to assemble too is to be exercised peacefully and without arms.
The government may impose restrictions in certain areas declaring the assembly of five or more persons as unlawful.
The genuine protest against an act or policy of government by the people may be denied Indian Constitution at Work permission.
However, if the people are aware and vigilant in regard to their rights and choose to protest against such acts of administration such misuse becomes rare.
In the Constituent Assembly itself, some members had expressed their dissatisfaction about restrictions on rights.
Rights of accused Somnath Lahiri [CAD, Vol. III, p. 404] Our Constitution ensures that persons accused of various offences would also get sufficient protection.
We often tend to believe that anyone who is charged with some offence is guilty.
However, no one is guilty unless the court has found that person guilty of an offence.
Itis also necessary that a person accused of any crime should get adequate opportunity to defend herself or himself.
To ensure a fair trial in courts, the Constitution has provided three rights: © no person would be punished for the same offence more than once, © no law shall declare any action as illegal from a backdate, and © no person shall be asked to give evidence against himself or herself.
Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution Check your progress Do you think that the following situations demand restrictions on right to freedom?
a. People have assembled for a peace march after communal riots in the city.
b. Dalits are denied entry ina temple.
A march is being organised to forcibly enter the temple.
c. Hundreds of tribals armed with their traditional weapons bows arrows and axes have blocked the road.
They are demanding that the surplus land taken for an industry be returned to them.
d. A caste panchayat is meeting to decide the punishment to a young couple for marrying outside their caste.
RIGHT AGAINST EXPLOITATION In our country there are millions of people who are underprivileged and deprived.
One such form of exploitation in our country has been begar or forced labour without payment.
Another closely related form of exploitation is buying and selling of human beings and using them as slaves.
Both of these are prohibited under the Constitution.
Forced labour was imposed by landlords, money lenders and other wealthy persons in the past.
Some form of bonded labour still continues in the country, specially in brick kiln work.
It has now been declared a crime and it is punishable.
Name the fundamental rights whose violation is depicted in this photograph.
Indian Constitution at Work The Constitution also forbids employment of children below the age of 14 years in dangerous jobs like factories and mines.
With child labour being made illegal and right to education becoming a fundamental right for children, this right against exploitation has become more meaningful.
RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF RELIGION According to our Constitution, everyone enjoys the right to follow the religion of his or her choice.
This freedom is considered as a hallmark of democracy.
Historically, there were rulers and emperors in different parts of the world who did not allow residents of their countries to enjoy the right to freedom of religion.
Persons following a religion different from that of the ruler were either persecuted or forced to convert to the official religion of the rulers.
Therefore, democracy has always incorporated the freedom to follow the religion of one’s choice as one of its basic principles.
Freedom of faith and worship In India, everyone is free to choose a religion and practice that religion.
Freedom of religion also includes the freedom of conscience.
This means that a person may choose any religion or may choose not to follow any religion.
Freedom of religion includes the freedom to profess, follow and propagate any religion. Freedom of religion is subject to certain limitations.
The government can impose restrictions on the practice of freedom of religion in order to protect public order, morality and health.
This means that the freedom of religion is not an unlimited right.
The government can interfere in religious matters for rooting out certain social evils.
For example in the past, the government has taken steps banning practices like sati, bigamy or human sacrifice.
Such restrictions cannot be opposed in the name of interference in right to freedom of religion.
The limitations on the right to freedom of religion always produce tensions between followers of various religions and the government.
When the government seeks to restrict some activities of any religious group, people of that religion feel that this is interference in their religion.
Freedom of religion becomes a matter of political controversy for yet another reason.
The Constitution has guaranteed the right to propagate one’s religion.
This includes persuading people to Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution convert from one religion to another.
However, some people resent conversions on the ground that these are based on intimidation or inducement.
The Constitution does not allow forcible conversions.
It only gives us the right to spread information about our religion and thus attract others to it.
Equality of all religions Being a country which is home to several religions, it is necessary that the government must extend equal treatment to different religions.
Negatively, it means that government will not favour any particular religion.
India does not have any official religion. We don’t have to belong to any particular religion in order to be a prime minister or president or judge or any other public official.
We have also seen that under the right to equality, there is a guarantee that government will not discriminate on the basis of religion in giving employment.
The institutions run by the state will not preach any religion or give religious education nor will they favour persons of any religion.
The objective of these provisions is to sustain and nurture the principle of secularism.
Activity Make a list of public religious activities that take place in your village or city.
Which of these involve an exercise of right to religious freedom?
Discuss what could have happened if this right was not available to people in your locality.
CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS When we talk of the Indian society, the image of diversity comes before our minds.
India is not made up of a monolithic society.
In such a society that is full of diversity, there would be social sections which are small in numbers compared to some other groups.
If a group is in minority, will it have to adopt the culture of the majority?
Our Constitution believes that diversity is our strength.
Therefore, one of the fundamental rights is the right of the minorities to maintain their culture. This minority status is not dependent only Sardar Hukam Singh [CAD VIII p. 322,] Indian Constitution at Work A heavy responsibility would be | the majority to see that in fact minorities feel secure.
...the only s for the minorities lies in a secular S It pays them to be nationalists .... majority community should not b of their national outlook.
All demand safeguards ...... are the product those fears that the minorities ha their minds, .... .. as regards t language, their script and also a the services.
upon religion. Linguistic and cultural minorities are also included in this provision.
Minorities are groups that have common language or religion and in a particular part of the country or in the country as a whole, they are outnumbered by some other social section.
Such communities have a culture, language and a script of their own, and have the right to conserve and develop these.
All minorities, religious or linguistic, can set up their own educational institutions.
By doing so, they can preserve and develop their own culture.
The government will not, while granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate against any educational institution on the basis that it is under the management of minority community.
RIGHT TO CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDIES One would agree that our Constitution contains a very impressive list of Fundamental Rights.
But merely writing down a list of rights is not enough.
There has to be a way through which they could be realised in practice and defended against any attack on these rights.
Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution Right to constitutional remedies is the means through which this is to be achieved.
Dr. Ambedkar considered the right to constitutional remedies as ‘heart and soul of the constitution’.
It is so because this right gives a citizen the right to approach a High Court or the Supreme Court to get any of the fundamental rights restored in case of their violation.
The Supreme Court and the High Courts can issue orders and give directives to the government for the enforcement of rights.
The courts can issue various special orders known as writs.
© Habeas corpus: A writ of habeas corpus means that the court orders that the arrested person should be presented before it.
It can also order to set free an arrested person if the manner or grounds of arrest are not lawful or satisfactory.
© Mandamus: This writ is issued when the court finds that a particular office holder is not doing legal duty and thereby is infringing on the right of an individual.
© Prohibition: This writ is issued by a higher court (High Court or Supreme Court) when a lower court has considered a case going beyond its jurisdiction.
© Quo Warranto: If the court finds that a person is holding office but is not entitled to hold that office, it issues the writ of quo warranto and restricts that person from acting as an office holder.
© Certiorari: Under this writ, the court orders a lower court or another authority to transfer a matter pending before it to the higher authority or court.
Apart from the judiciary, many other mechanisms have been created in later years for the protection of rights.
You may have heard about the National Commission on Minorities, the National Commission on Women, the National Commission on Scheduled Castes, I am in minority in my locality but majority in the town, minority if you look, at my language but majority if you go by my religion... Aren’t we all minorities?
These institutions protect the rights of women, minorities or Dalits.
Besides, the National Human Rights Commission has also been established by law to protect the fundamental and other kinds of rights.
Human Rights Commission The real test of the rights given by any constitution is in their actual implementation.
The poor, illiterate and the deprived sections of the society must be able to exercise their rights.
Independent organisations like the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) or People’s Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR) have been working as watchdogs against the violations of rights.
In this background, the government has established in 2000 an institution, the National Human Rights Commission.
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is composed of a former chief justice of the Supreme Court of India, a former judge of the Supreme Court, a former chief justice of a High Court and two other members who have knowledge and practical experience in matters relating to human rights.
The commission’s functions include inquiry at its own initiative or on a petition presented to it by a victim into complaint of violation of human rights; visit to jails to study the condition of the inmates; undertaking and promoting research in the field of human rights etc.
The commission receives complaints in thousands every year.
These relate to custodial death, custodial rape, disappearances, police excesses, failure in taking action, indignity to women etc.
Its most significant intervention has been on disappeared youth in Punjab and investigation and trial of Gujarat riot cases where its intervention proved effective.
The commission does not have the power of prosecution.
It can merely make recommendations to the government or recommend to the courts to initiate proceedings based on the inquiry that it conducts.
Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY The makers of our Constitution knew that independent India was going to face many challenges.
Foremost among these was the challenge to bring about equality and well-being of all citizens.
They also thought that certain policy direction was required for handling these problems.
At the same time, the Constitution did not want future governments to be bound by certain policy decisions.
Therefore, some guidelines were incorporated in the Constitution but they were not made legally enforceable: this means that if a government did not implement a particular guideline, we cannot go to the court asking the court to instruct the government to implement that policy.
Thus, these guidelines are ‘non-justiciable’ i.e., parts of the Constitution that cannot be enforced by the judiciary.
Those who framed our Constitution thought that the moral force behind these guidelines would ensure that the government would take them seriously.
Besides, they expected that the people would also hold the governments responsible for implementing these directives.
So, a separate list of policy guidelines is included in the Constitution.
The list of these guidelines is called the Directive Principles of State Policy.
What do the Directive Principles contain?
The chapter on Directive Principles lists mainly three things: © the goals and objectives that we as a society should adopt; © certain rights that individuals should enjoy apart from the Fundamental Rights; and © certain policies that the government should adopt.
You may get some idea of the vision of makers of our Constitution by looking at some of the Directive Principles shown below.
The governments from time to time tried to give effect to some Directive Principles of State Policy.
They passed several zamindari abolition bills, nationalised banks, enacted numerous factory laws, fixed minimum wages, cottage and small industries were promoted and provisions for reservation for the uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes were made.
Such efforts to give effect to the Directive Principles include the right to education, formation of Indian Constitution at Work panchayati raj institutions all over the country, partial right to work under employment guarantee programme and the mid-day meal scheme etc.
Fundamental Duties of citizens In 1976, the 42™ amendment to the Constitution was passed.
Among other things, this amendment inserted a list of Fundamental Duties of Citizens. In all, ten duties were enumerated.
However, the Constitution does not say anything about enforcing these duties.
As citizens, we must abide by the Constitution, defend our country, promote harmony among all citizens, protect the environment.
However, it must be noted that our Constitution does not make the enjoyment of rights dependent or conditional upon fulfilment of duties.
In this sense, the inclusion of fundamental duties has not changed the status of our fundamental rights.
Check your progress It is estimated that there are about three million urban homeless in India.
Night shelters are not available for more than five per cent of this population.
Hundreds of these old, sick homeless people are killed by cold wave during winter.
They cannot have ration and voting cards in the absence of any ‘proof of residence’.
A large number of these homeless people are casual workers, who earn very low wages.
Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES It is possible to see both Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles as complementary to each other.
Fundamental Rights restrain the government from doing certain things while Directive DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES Goals Welfare of the people; Social, economic and political justice; Raising the standard of Non-justiciable rights living; equitable distribution of resources; Adequate livelihood equal pay for equal work (for men promotion of international and women) peace Right against economic Exploitation. Right to work; Policies Right of children to free and Uniform civil code; compulsory education Prohibition of consumption of alcoholic liquor; Promotion of cottage industries; Prevention of slaughter of useful cattle; Tell me what is the point of saying nice things in Promotion of village the Constitution if these panchayats.
Indian Constitution at Work Principles exhort the government to do certain things.
Fundamental Rights mainly protect the rights of individuals while directive principles ensure the well-being of the entire society.
However, at times, when government intends to implement Directive Principles of State Policy, it can come in conflict with the Fundamental Rights of the citizen.
This problem arose when the government sought to pass laws to abolish zamindari system.
These measures were opposed on the ground that they violated right to property.
However, keeping in mind the societal needs that are greater than the individual interests, the government amended the Constitution to give effect to the Directive Principles of State Policy.
This led to a long legal battle.
The executive and the judiciary took different positions.
The government claimed that rights can be abridged for giving effect to Directive Principles.
This argument assumed that rights were a hindrance to welfare of the people.
On the other hand, the court held the view that Fundamental Rights were so important and sacred that they cannot be limited even for purposes of implementing Directive Principles.
Right to Property Behind the controversy about the relationship between rights and directive principles, there was one important reason: in the Constitution, originally, there was a fundamental right to ‘acquire, possess and maintain’ property.
But the Constitution made it clear that property could be taken away by the government for public welfare.
Since 1950, government made many laws that limited this right to property.
This right was at the centre of the long debate over the relationship between rights and directive principles.
Finally, in 1973, the Supreme Court gave a decision that the right to property was not part of the basic structure of the Constitution and therefore, parliament had power to abridge this right by an amendment.
In 1978, the 44 amendment to the Constitution removed the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights and converted it into a simple legal right.
What difference, do you think, this change of status makes to the right to property?
Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution This generated another complicated debate.
This related to the amendment of the Constitution.
The government was saying that 47 Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution.
The court was saying that Parliament cannot make an amendment that violated Fundamental Rights.
This controversy was settled by an important decision of the Supreme Court in Kesavananda Bharati case.
In this case, the court said that there are certain basic features of the Constitution and these cannot be changed by Parliament.
We shall discuss this in greater detail in Chapter 9 on ‘Constitution as a Living Document’.

Why did the South African Constitution put these in the Bill of Rights? If you were writing the constitution for a new country, what would you suggest?
Conclusion In the writings of Jotirao Phuley (1827-1890), a radical social reformer from Maharashtra, we find one of the earliest expressions of the view that rights include both freedom and equality.
During the national movement, this idea of rights was further sharpened and expanded to constitutional rights.
Our Constitution reflected this long tradition and listed the fundamental rights.
Since 1950, the judiciary has functioned as an important protector of rights.
Judicial interpretations have expanded the scope of rights in many respects.
The government and administration of our country function within this overall framework.
Rights enforce limitations on the functioning of the government and ensure democratic governance of the country.
Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution Exercises Write true or false against each of these statements: a) A Bill of Rights lays down the rights enjoyed by the people of a country.

What would happen if the black Rnight suddenly started moving straight rather than two and a half squares?
Or, what would happen if in a game of cricket, there were no umpires?
In any sport, we need to follow certain rules.
Change the rules and the outcome of the game would be very different.
Similarly a game needs an impartial umpire whose decision is accepted by all the players.
The rules and the umpire have to be agreed upon before we begin to play a game.
What is true of a game is also true of elections.
There are different rules or systems of conducting elections.
The outcome of the election depends on the rules we have adopted.
We need some machinery to conduct the elections in an impartial manner.
Since these two decisions need to be taken before the game of electoral politics can begin, these cannot be left to any government.
That is why these basic decisions about elections are written down in the constitution of a democratic country.
In this chapter we shall study the constitutional provisions regarding elections and representation.
We shall focus on the importance of the method of election chosen in our Constitution and the implications of the constitutional provisions regarding impartial machinery for conducting elections.
We shall also look, at some suggestions for amending the constitutional provisions in this respect.
After reading this chapter, you would understand: © different methods of election; the characteristics of the system of election adopted in our country; the importance of the provisions for free and fair elections; and the debate on electoral reforms.
© Oo © प्र wd ea} A S ठ a oO i Dn ELECTIONS AND DEMOCRACY Indian Constitution at Work Let us begin by asking ourselves two simple questions about elections and democracy.
© Can we hold elections without having democracy?
Let us have a discussion in the classroom on both these questions by using examples from whatever we have learnt so far in the previous classes.
The first question reminds us of the necessity of representation in a large democracy.
All citizens cannot take direct part in making every decision.
Therefore, representatives are elected by the people.
Whenever we think of India as a democracy, our mind invariably turns to the last elections.
Elections have today become the most visible symbol of the democratic process.
We often distinguish between direct and indirect democracy.
The ancient city-states in Greece were considered examples of direct democracy.
Many would consider local governments, especially gram sabhas, to be the closest examples of direct Chapter 3: Election and Representation democracy.
But this kind of direct democracy cannot be practiced when a decision has to be taken by lakhs and crores of people.
That is why rule by the people usually means rule by people’s representatives.
In such an arrangement citizens choose their representatives who, in turn, are actively involved in governing and administering the country.
The method followed to choose these representatives is referred to as an election.
Thus, the citizens have a limited role in taking major decisions and in running the administration.
They are not very actively involved in making of the policies.
Citizens are involved only indirectly, through their elected representatives.
In this arrangement, where all major decisions are taken by elected representatives, the method by which people elect their representatives becomes very important.
The second question reminds us of the fact that not all elections are democratic.
A large number of non- democratic countries also hold elections.
In fact non- democratic rulers are very keen to present themselves as democratic.
They do so by holding election in such a way that it does not threaten their rule.
Can you think of some examples of such non-democratic elections?
What do you think would distinguish a democratic from a non- democratic election?
What can be done to ensure that elections in a country would be conducted in a democratic way?
This is where constitution comes in. The constitution of a democratic country lays down some basic rules about elections.
These basic rules are usually about Who is eligible to vote?
Who is eligible to contest?
Who is to supervise elections?
How do the voters choose their representatives?
How are the votes to be counted and representatives elected?
Indian Constitution at Work Like most democratic constitutions, the Constitution of India answers all these questions.
As you can see, the first three questions are about ensuring that elections are free and fair and can thus be called democratic.
In this chapter you will consider both these aspects of the Constitutional provisions about elections.
Activity Collect newspaper clippings about elections in India and any other country.
Classify the clippings in the following categories: a.
System of representation b. Voter eligibility c. Role of the Election Commission.
If you have access to internet, visit the website of the project Election Process Information Collection (www.epicproject.org) and collect the information mentioned above for at least four countries.
ELECTION SYSTEM IN INDIA You may have noted above a reference to different methods or the systems of elections.
You may have wondered what these were all about.
You may have seen or read about different methods of electioneering or campaigning in the elections.
But what are different methods of elections?
There is a system of conducting elections.
There are authorities and rules about do’s and don'ts.
Is that what election system is all about?
You may have wondered why the constitution needs to write down how the votes are to be counted and representatives elected.
Isn’t that very obvious?
People go and vote.
The candidate who gets highest votes gets elected.
That is what elections are all over the world.
Why do we need to think about it?
We need to, because this question is not as simple as it appears to us.
We have got so used to our system of elections that we think that there cannot be any other way.
In a democratic election, people vote and their preference decides who will win the contest.
But there Chapter 3: Election and Representation Activity Hold mock elections in your class to elect four class representatives.
Hold the election in three different ways: © Each student can give one vote.
The four highest vote getters are elected.
© Each student has four votes and can give them all to one candidate or split the votes among different candidates.
The four highest vote getters are elected. © Each voter gives a preference ranking to candidates and the counting follows the method of election of Rajya Sabha members described below.
Did the same four persons win the election in each of these methods?
If not, what was the difference?
can be very different ways in which people make their choices and very different ways in which their preferences can be counted. These different rules of the game can make a difference to who the winner of the game will be.
Some rules can favour bigger parties; some rules can help the smaller players.
Some rules can favour the majority community, others can protect the minorities.
Let us look at one dramatic instance to see how this happens.
First Past the Post System Look at the newspaper clipping.
cy Tha Ree a लाल चाहा में हफ्ते Sew cori Fate the Sem sey ae at Pott chert ys ferret toce ite ६ मक्त हैं.
१३०६ iis oa j Ae fe on Ape इस्तीफा के Let Less than 50 per cent votesand more than 80 per cent seats! Isn't that unfair?
How could our Constitution makers accept such an unfair system?
In the Lok Sabha elections of 1984, the Congress party came to power winning 415 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats — more than 80% of the seats.
Such a victory was never achieved by any party in the Lok Sabha.
What did this election show?
The Congress party won four-fifths of the seats.
Does it mean that four out of five Indian voters voted for the Congress party?
Take a look at the enclosed table.
The Congress party got 48% of the votes.
This means that only 48% of those who voted, voted in favour of the candidates put up by the Congress party, but the party still managed to win more than 80% of the seats in the Lok Sabha.
Look at the performance of other parties.
The BJP got 7.4 per cent votes but less than one per cent seats.
How did that happen?
Votes and seats won by some major parties in Lok Sabha Election of 1984 Party Votes (%) Seats Congress 48. 0 415 BJP 7.4 2 Janata 6.7 10 Lok Dal 5.7 3 CPI (M) 5.7 22 Telugu Desam 4.1 30 DMK 2.3 2 AIADMK 1.6 12 Akali Dal 1.0 7 AGP 1.0 7 This happened because in our country we follow a special method of elections.
Under this system: © The entire country is divided into 543 constituencies; © Each constituency elects one representative; and © The candidate who secures the highest number of votes in that constituency is declared elected.
It is important to note that in this system whoever has Chapter 3: Election and Representation more votes than all other candidates, is declared elected.
The winning candidate need not secure a majority of the votes.
This method is called the First Past the Post (FPTP) system.
In the electoral race, the candidate who is ahead of others, who crosses the winning post first of all, is the winner.
This method is also called the Plurality System.
This is the method of election prescribed by the Constitution.
Let us now go back to our example.
The Congress party won greater share of seats than its share of votes because in many of the constituencies in which its candidates won, they secured less than 50% of the votes.
If there are several candidates, the winning candidate often gets much less than 50% of the votes.
The votes that go to all the losing candidates go ‘waste’, for those candidates or parties get no seat from those votes.
Suppose a party gets only 25 per cent of the votes in every constituency, but everyone else gets even less votes.
In that case, the party could win all the seats with only 25 per cent votes or even less.
Proportional Representation Let us compare this to how elections take place in Israel that follows a very different system of elections.
In Israel once the votes are counted, each party is allotted the share of seats in the parliament in proportion to its share of votes (See Box).
Each party fills its quota of seats by picking those many of its nominees from a preference list that has been declared before the elections.
This system of elections is called the Proportional Representation (PR) system.
In this system a party gets the same proportion of seats as its proportion of votes.
In the PR system there could be two variations.
In some countries, like Israel or Netherlands, the entire country is treated as one constituency and seats are allocated to each party according to its share of votes in the national election.
The other method is when the country is divided into several multi-member This is very confusing!
How do I Rnow who is my MP or my MLA in this system?
Who would I go to if I have any work?
Indian Constitution at Work constituencies as in Argentina and Portugal.
Each party prepares a list of candidates for each constituency, depending on how many have to be elected from that constituency.
In both these variations, voters exercise their preference for a party and not a candidate.
The seats in a constituency are distributed on the basis of votes polled by a party.
In India, we have adopted PR system E Representation in Israel Israel follows proportional representation system of election.
Elections to the legislature (Knesset) take place every four years.
Every party declares a list of its candidates, but voters vote for the party and not for the candidates.
A party gets seats in the legislature in proportion to the votes polled by it.
This allows even smaller parties with very small support base to get representation in the legislature. (A party must get a minimum of 1.5 per cent votes in order to be eligible to get seats in the legislature.)
This often leads to a multi-party coalition government.
The following table shows the result of the 2003 elections to the Knesset.
Based on this, you can find out what percentage of votes various parties got in that election.

The Constitution prescribes a third and complex variation of the PR system for the election of 59 President, Vice President, and for the election to the Rajya Sabha and Vidhan Parishads.
Examples: Israel, Netherlands Indian Constitution at Work How does PR work in Rajya Sabha elections A third variant of PR, the Single Transferable Vote system (STV), is followed for Rajya Sabha elections.
Every State has a specific quota of seats in the Rajya Sabha.
The members are elected by the respective State legislative assemblies.
The voters are the MLAs in that State.
Every voter is required to rank candidates according to her or his preference.
To be declared the winner, a candidate must secure a minimum quota of votes, which is determined by a formula: Total votes polled Total number of candidates to be elected +1 For example if 4 Rajya Sabha members have to be elected by the 200 MLAs in Rajasthan, the winner would require (200/4+1= 40+1) 41 votes.
Why did India adopt the FPTP system? The answer is not very difficult to guess.
If you have carefully read the box explaining the Rajya Sabha elections, you would have noticed that it is a complicated system which may work in a small country, but would be difficult to work in a sub-continental country like India.
The reason for the popularity and success of the FPTP system is its simplicity.
The entire election system is extremely simple to understand even for common voters who may have no specialised Chapter 3: Election and Representation knowledge about politics and elections.
There is also a clear choice presented to the voters at the time of elections.
Voters have to simply endorse a candidate or a party while voting.
Depending on the nature of actual politics, voters may either give greater importance to the party or to the candidate or balance the two.
The FPTP system offers voters a choice not simply between parties but specific candidates.
In other electoral systems, especially PR systems, voters are often asked to choose a party and the representatives are elected on the basis of party lists.
As a result, there is no one representative who represents and is responsible for one locality.
In constituency based system like the FPTP, the voters know who their own representative is and can hold him or her accountable.

Was this the effect of our electoral system?
More importantly, the makers of our Constitution also felt that PR based election may not be suitable for giving a stable government in a parliamentary system.
We shall study the nature of parliamentary system of executive in the next chapter.
This system requires that the executive has majority in the legislature.
You will notice that the PR system may not produce a clear majority because seats in the legislature would be divided on the basis of share of votes.

© What would be the composition of the Assembly if it was a PR system like in Israel?
Thus this system makes it possible for parliamentary government to function smoothly and effectively by facilitating the formation of a stable government.
Finally, the FTPT system encourages voters from different social groups to come together to win an election in a locality.
In a diverse country like India, a PR system would encourage each community to form its own nation-wide party.
This may also have been at the back of the mind of our constitution makers.
The experience of the working of the Constitution has confirmed the expectation of the constitution makers.
The FPTP system has proved to be simple and familiar to ordinary voters.
It has helped larger parties to win clear majorities at the centre and the State level.
The system has also discouraged political parties that get all their Chapter 3: Election and Representation votes only from one caste or community.
Normally, the working of the FPTP system results in a two-party system.
This means that there are two major competitors for power and power is often shared by these two parties alternately.
It is difficult for new parties or the third party to enter the competition and share power.
In this respect, the experience of FPTP in India is slightly different.
After independence, though we adopted the FPTP system, there emerged a one party dominance and along with it, there existed many smaller parties.
After 1989, India is witnessing the functioning of the multi- party coalitions.
At the same time, gradually, in many States, a two party competition is emerging.
But the distinguishing feature of India’s party system is that the rise of coalitions has made it possible for new and smaller parties to enter into electoral competition in spite of the FPTP system.
RESERVATION OF CONSTITUENCIES We have noticed that in the FPTP election system, the candidate who secures the highest votes in a particular constituency is declared elected.
This often works to the disadvantage of the smaller social groups.
This is even more significant in the Indian social context.
We have had a history of caste based discrimination.
In such a social system, the FPTP electoral system can mean that the dominant social groups and castes can win everywhere and the oppressed social groups may continue to remain unrepresented.
Our Constitution makers were aware of this difficulty and the need to provide a way to ensure fair and just representation to the oppressed social groups.
This system meant “Separate electorates have been a curse to India, have done incalculable harm to this country....... 0... ...
Separate electorates have blurred our progress... कर We (Muslims) want to merge in the nation.
.....For God’s sake, keep your hands off reservations for the Muslim community..” Tajamul Hussain CAD, Vol. VIII, p. 333 Indian Constitution at Work that for electing a representative from a particular community, only those voters would be eligible who belong to that community.
In the constituent assembly, many members expressed a fear that this will not suit our purposes.
Therefore, it was decided to adopt the system of reserved constituencies.
In this system, all voters in a constituency are eligible to vote but the candidates must belong to only a particular community or social section for which the seat is reserved.
There are certain social groups which may be spread across the country.
In a particular constituency, their numbers may not be sufficient to be able to influence a victory of a candidate.
However, taken across the country they are a significantly sizeable group.
To ensure their proper representation, a system of reservation becomes necessary.
The Constitution provides for reservation of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
This provision was made initially for a period of 10 years and as a result of successive constitutional amendments, has been extended up to 2010.
The Parliament can take a decision to further extend it, when the period of reservation expires.
The number of seats reserved for both of these groups is in proportion to their share in the population of India.
Today, of the 543 elected seats in the Lok Sabha, 79 are reserved for Scheduled Castes and 41 are reserved for Scheduled Tribes.

....We are willing ix with you, and it is for that reason, ..... , that we h sisted on a reservation of seats as far as the Legislatu re concerned.

Jaipal Singh CAD, Vol. V, p. 226 Chapter 3: Election and Representation Who decides which constituency is to be reserved?
On what basis is this decision taken?
This decision is taken by an independent body called the Delimitation Commission.
The Delimitation Commission is appointed by the President of India and works in collaboration with the Election Commission of India.
