Since then so efforts have been made to introduce the Adoption of Children Bill in order to reform and modernised law in our country, 3.2.
These clauses will be discussed later.
The welfare of the child was the paramount consideration for adoption of a child under the 1980 Bill.
(d) In respect of a provisional adoption order, the elements present are-- (1) an applicant, a person who is not domiciled in India, intends to adopt a child under the law of the country in which he is domiciled; (2) for the purpose of intended adoption the applicant desires to remove the child from India to his country; (3) the Court in this situation may make a provisional adoption order authorising the applicant to remove the child for intended adaption; (4) the Court gives the care and custody of the child to the applicant pending his adoption in country of his domicile.
A radical shift from the ancient laws and practices to the contem- porary laws and practices on adoptions in most states in the world has caused profound impact on the International Law on adoption.
(c) A child of tender years shall not, save in exceptional circumstances, be separated from his mother.
This convention has recognised inter-country adoption as an alternative means of child's care when he cannot be adopted in the country of his origin and it emphasises that objectives of inter-country adoption are to be promoted where appropriate, by bilateral or multilateral agreements.'
The functions of a Central Authority for the aforesaid purposes may be performed by public authorities or bodies to the extent permitted by the law of its state.
Any legislative exercise should consider both these set of principles.
(6) The biological parents should not be subjected to any duress in making a decision about relinquishment of the child.
On receiving an application from a foreigner for adoption of an Indian child, the recognised agency must send the photograph and child study report of a suitable child who fit into the environment and community of the prospec- tive adopter for the purpose of obtaining approval to the adoption of such child from the foreigner wishing to adopt Indian child.
The Law Commission is of the opinion that it is desirable to bear in mind these judicial guidelines in codifying law as these are directly relevant for the purpose of the intercountry adoption.
The High Court of Delhi tias also issued instructions (1984) 2 SCR, 795 5.
They believe that society must value its children and solve the problem of their destitution.
On a close scrutiny and analysis of the responses, we find that the ex- perience gained by agencies shows a remarkable phenomenon that contrary to general belief Indian children adonted by foreign parents are looked after well and they have full opportunities for their development.
The NRI applications should be routed through Indian agencies recognised by Government of India to maintain a watch through follow up reports.
Such law when enacted will foster respect for international law and treaty obligations as envisaged under Article 51(c) of the Constitution of India.
In the case of adoption of a child by spouses the require- ment as to age under this Sub-section shall be deemed to have heen satisfied if either of the spouses has completed the age of twenty-five years (2) A foreigner who is married shall not be cniitled to adopt a child him- self or herself alone but the husband and wife may, jointly adopt a child.
(3) A foreigner who is not married seeking to adopt a child shall be older than the child by at least twenty-one years: Provided that the court may disperse with the requirements of this sub- section, if it is satisfied that there are any special circumstances which render it necessary to do so.
Consents.-(1) No adoption order in respect of a child shall be made except with the consent of the parents of the child or the instituion having care of the child.
:(2) Ady person who takes or seride a child out of India to any place out- side India di contravention of sub-section (1) on Halbs to take part, t arrange- ments for transferring the care and custody of a child to any person for that purpose shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine, or with both.
Important social and psychological experiences which have had a bearing on their desire to adopt a child.
Have they obtained the neecssary permission to adopt?
An undertaking that they would maintain the child and provide it neces- sary education and upbringing according to their status.
(k) A power of attorney in favour of an officer of the social or child welfare agency in India which is requested to process the case and such power of attorney should authorise the attorney to handle the case on behalf of the foreigner in case the foreigner is not in a position to come to India.
In these meetings, adoptees are able to discuss and come to terms with various issues on adoption.
It is this agency which forwards the documents to the Indian recognised child welfare agencies and is fully responsible for the placement of the child in case of any problem and also undertakes to do post placement reporting as per the requirement of the Indian Courts.
CHAPTER - I INTRODUCTION The origin of Crimes and of Criminal Law lies in a primitive system, by which all wrongs were redressed by private revenge; a system of self-redress, based on the principle of Retaliation.
Death sentence and life imprisonment , awarded by Sessions Judges, were subject to confirmation by the Nizamat Adalat.
The Title of "Indian Penal Code" given by the Law Commission to the basic criminal law aptly describes its contents.
However before passing the Bill, the then Lok Sabha was dissolved and the said Bill could not find a place in the book of statutes.
However, at this stage, we may also mention that under Clause 197 of the Bill, for the existing Chapter XIX, a new Chapter bearing the same number (Chapter XIX) is sought to be inserted to deal with "offences against Privacy".
It is also mentioned that Law Commission is proposing to take up a comprehensive study on this subject separately as early as possible.
The purpose which punishment achieves or is required to achieve are fourfold.'
As against the retributive, deterrent and preventive theories of punishment, the reformative approach to punishment as a measure to reclaim the offender lays emphasis on rehabilitation so that the offenders are transformed into good citizens.
The question is not one of mere proximity in time or place.
The time that may elapse between the moment when the preparations made for committing the fraud are brought to bear upon the mind of the person to be deceived and the moment when he yields to the deception practised upon him may be a very considerable interval of time.
It does not say that the last act which would form the final part of an attempt in the larger sense is the only act punishable under the section.
Conspiracy to commit offences punishable by section 121- Whoever within or without India conspires to commit any of the offences punishable by section 121, or conspires to overawe, by means of criminal force or the show of criminal force, the Central Government or any State Government, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
At present, the award of simple imprisonment is permissible under the section, which in view of the gravity of the offence is not appropriate.
On the other hand, while promotion of public disorder in some form or other is considered an essential ingredient of seditious conduct in England, this idea is not brought out in the wording of section 124A.
These aspects are rightly emphasised in defining sedition in other codes and section 124 A should be revised to take them in.
7.18 For the reasons discussed above, the section 124-A Day be substituted.
However, on the basis of those recommendations, Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 has been enacted.
7.23 Section 125 makes it an offence to wage war against the Government of any Asiatic Power in alliance or at peace with the Government of India.
The Law Commission had already proposed that the punishment should be imprisonment of either description not exceeding ten years, and also fine.
Consequently it was held to be violative of Article 21.
Rape is an act of violence affecting the physical and emotional integrity and dignity of the victim.2 9.02.
The punishment for the offence also may be provided in a separate section."
The Commission added that it shall be a defence to a charge under this section for the accused to prove that he, in good faith, believed the girl to be above sixteen years of age.
Instead, the Commission recommended leaving rape of child-wife (S.375A) in the general Section 375 instead of placing it in a separate section.
The Commission proceeded to say: "Under the amendment as recommended, it would not be open to the court to draw an inference of consent on the part of the woman from her silence due to timidity or meekness or from such circumstances without any more,- as that the girl meekly followed the offender when he pulled her, catching hold of her hand, or that the woman kept silent and did not shout or protest or cry out for help."
Fifthly.-With her consent, when at the time of giving such consent, by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication or the administration by him personally or through another of any stupefying or unwholesome substance she is unable to understand the nature and consequences of that to which she gives consent.
Intercourse by a man with his wife during separation.- Whoever has sexual intercourse with his own wife, who is living separately from him under a decree of separation or under any custom or usage without her consent shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years and shall also be liable to fine."
The Report points out that Delhi, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Pondicherry have been categorised as "high crime prone" States.
An analysis of 1996 crime data showed that in 88 per cent of the rape cases relatives and acquaintances were involved and in 89 per cent of the cases the crime was committed at home.
9.32.The proponents of this view advocate that the sections of IPC dealing with rape (sections 375 and 376) and sections 354 and 509 be repealed and be substituted by provisions on "Sexual Assault" - to be defined broadly to include all forms of sexual violence on women including rape.
The National Commission for women has recommended that section 375 be amended to change the reference of age to 16 years in clause 'Sixthly' (rape with or without her consent) to 18 years.
Bigamy.- Whoever, being married, contracts another marriage in any case in which such marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the subsistence of the earlier marriage, commits bigamy.
The punishment of five years remains the same.
The court shall, however, have discretion to reduce the sentence for adequate and special reasons to be recorded in the judgment.
Article 45 mandates the State to provide for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of 14 years.
Article 35 requires States to take all measures to prevent the abduction of the sale of or traffic in children for any purpose or in any form.
Id., para 16.120, page 278.
However, this clause does not deal with the vischief intended to be committed with the private aircraft.
In the meantime, the - problem of "Air Hijacking" was increased and it was felt urgently to have an effective piece of legislation to deal with the burning problem.
The said Act (NO 65/1982) came into existence on 15th November 1982. of Section 3 of the Act explains the crime hijacking" as under- "3.
(2) Whoever attempts to commit, or abets the commission of, any offence under sub-section (1) shall also be deemed to have committed such offence and shall be punishable with the punishment provided for such offence."
Section 5 of the Code is important and has wisely left all pre-existing, special, or local laws.
Besides this, it 18 further provided that a person also commits an offence if he attempts to commit any of the röffences mentioned above or if he is an accomplice of a person who commits or attempts to commit any such offence.
Under this convention, the state parties have undertaken that they will provide deterrent punishment to the hijackers.
If the decision is in che affirmative, the above mentioned universal jurisdictional :lause ensures that the courts will be competent to hear the ase.
With this view their Lordships of the Privy Council agreed in Srinivasa Mall vs. Emperor (AIR 1947 P.C.135).
This presumption, however, is not conclusive, nor alone sufficient to justily a conviction and should be supplemented by other testimony: eliminated in the administration of criminal Justice.
By making this crime a "Statutory Crime", all the controversies (like whether the said crime can be covered or not in Chapter XVII), will disappear.
Some doubt was however, noticed as to whether it includes mechanical records of sound or image.
In addition, two lew chapters, namely, Chapters VB and XVIIIA are inserted and Chapter XXIII containing section 511 under the title 'Attempts to commit offences" has been omitted.
Besides, some of the sections or ilauses or sub-clauses are renumbered.
Section 7 adds that every expression which is explained in any part of the Code, is used in every part of the code in conformity with the explanation.
Consequently, clauses 2 to 8 of the 311 have to be deleted.
After noting these observations, the Law Commission opined that the expression "public servant" cannot be easily defined and no court has attempted any such definition.
The Law Commission in its 42nd Report observed in other words under the present definition of the term "legally bound to do" unless a law which enjoins a person to do a particular thing also lays down, in so many words, that the person shall not omit to do that thing, then the person cannot be considered "legally bound to do" that thing.
For the same reasons mentioned above in respect of clause 12, etc., the section need not be omitted and accordingly Clause 16 of the Bill has to be omitted.
Section 55A defines appropriate government that can exercise the powers under sections 54 and 55, namely, the Central and State Governments.
These revised sections provide for the sentence to be imposed in default for payment of fine etc., and the amendments are incidental and they may be carried out.
This omission is necessary in view of the new revised section 68.
The proposed section 748 provides for compensation to the victims.
Sections 115 and 116 deal with the punishments for successful abetment of offence.
A perusal of the new provision sought to be included would show that they are in conformity with the recommendations of the law Commission and we are also of the view that the changes are warranted.
We have discussed all these aspects in Chapter NO.VII in detail and we have also given reasons why the changes should be carried out.
We agree that section 153C may accordingly be added.
Therefore we agree that 167A may be inserted.
Clause 123 12.45 After section 292 a new section 292A is sought to be inserted.
A perusal of this new section shows that the object of inserting the same is to prevent the irresponsible way of printing newspapers, periodicals or other exhibits meant for public view in such matter when the same is intended for blackmailing.
The Law Commission in its 42nd Report observed that the word "privation" used in the existing section is archaic and "emasculation" in that clause may be omitted as the same is covered by the widened 5th clause.
Therefore, the substitution accordingly be made.
But in the new section the word "dishonestly" itself indicates the intention of causing wrongful gain or wrongful loss which naturally implies the delivery of property or valued security, etc.
Clause 178 12.76 Under this clause Section 420 is sought to be substituted by a new Section with some changes.
We may also add that we are making these suggestions, firstly because we have already recommended deletion of new section 362A to the extent applicable to the aircraft and also for the reason that so many technical issues would be involved in these kinds of offences and the special courts with the help of technicians acting as assessors would be in a better position to understand and decide the complicated questions that may arise.
Clause 184 of the Bill seeks to bring about the aforesaid recommendations (i) and (ii) except (iii).
We are of the view that though the position is now settled it would be desirable to add an Explanation in section 464, IPC so as to make it specifically clear that knowingly committing forgery of a copy of a document or knowingly making copy of a false document or making a false copy of a document would also amount to forgery within the meaning of section 464, IPC.
We agree with the insertion of the proposed new section 489F.
The proposed section 491, makes the taking of unauthorised photography is made punishable for imprisonment upto six months, and if one pubiishes such photograph, the imprisonment may extend to one year.
Similarly, the Law Reform Commission of the Ireland in its consultation Paper headed Privacy; Surveillance and Interception of communications' has provisionally recommended for the enaction of a separate Act to protect the privacy of the individual from intrusive surveillance.
Clause 203 12.92 The Law Commission has recommended in para 22.6 read with para 7.9 of its 42nd Report that clause (a) of sub-section (1)) of Section 505, IPC should be incorporated with certain modifications in Chapter VII as new section 138A on the lines mentioned in the Report.
CHAPTER - XIII CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS We have now come to the end of our detailed study of the code.
We have indicated in each Chapter of this Report, corresponding to a chapter of the code, the provisions which should be made in lieu of, or in addition to the existing provisions, and also the amendments, both major and minor, to be made in them.
The proposed Section 740 provides for imposition of the punishment by way of public censure in addition to the substantive sentence under sub-section and this is limited to offences mentioned in chapters XII, XIII, sections 272 to 276, 383 to 389, 403 to 409, 415 to 420 and offences under chapter XVIII of the code as offences under proposed new sections 4204 and 462A under the Indian Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, 1978.
It is voiced in various workshops that in view of the changes in the modern society, the type of crimes and the repetition of those crimes or the frequent occurrence of certain types of crimes, it is necessary that the punishment should be imprisonment and in addition fine also.
The Law Commission recommends that no change is required in Section 302 as is proposed in clause 125 of the Bill.
CHAPTER -VI ATTEMPT - Insertion of new sections 120 C & 120 D by way of new Chapter VB in the Bill The Indian Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, 1978 made a provision for this new Chapter under clause 45.
After reexamining the matter, we are of the view that section 124A may be substituted as recommended.
Adultery.- Whoever has sexual intercourse with a person who is, and whom he or she knows, or has reason to believe, to be the wife or husband, as the case may be, of another person, without the consent or connivance of that other person, such sexual intercourse not amounting to the offence of rape, commits adultery, and shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine or with both."
(Para 9.46) If section 497 is amended on the lines indicated above, sub-section (2) of section 198 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 would also need to be suitably amended.
Explanation- In this section- (i) The word "Vehicle" include any vessel but does not include an aircraft.".
"Explanation (3):- The term 'document' includes any disc, tape, sound track or other device on or in which any matter or image or sound is recorded or stored by mechanical or other means".
(Para 12.08) Clause_14 - Under this clause it is proposed to substitute Section 40 by another Section.
We also do not recommend incorporation of new Section 740.
(ii) We recommend that the third paragraph in the existing Section be included in the proposed Section and rearrange the clauses.
(vi) Under clause 36, a minor amendment to Section is proposed.
(Para 12.27) 27.
We are of the view that the proposed Section 124B need not be inserted.
Since these sections had already been repealed by the Prevention of corruption Act, 1988 and transposed thereto, clauses 63 and 64 have to be, therefore, omitted.
We are of the view that the proposed Section 166A may be inserted.
We are of the view that Section 292A may be inserted.
In content, both the sections are same except in the new Section in place of "unwholesome drug or other thing" the words "unwholesome substance" are inserted which are of same effect but little wider.
(Para 12.63) Clause 163- Under this clause, the words "may be punished with imprisonment for life" occurring in Sections 388 and 389 are sought to be substituted with imprisonment of lesser periods.
The proposed changes may be carried out.
li) We recommend that the word "Aircraft" occuring in the proposed Section 434 may be omitted in view of our suggestion made in Chapter X.
(Para 12.81) Clause 184 - By this clause, an amendment is sought to be inserted in Section 464 of the IPC.
(Para 12.84) Clause 190 - Under this clause, the existing Section 474 is sought to be substituted.
li) Since there is a need to have separate legislation on the subject, the proposed substitution may not be carried out.
(ii) We further recommend that existing Section 491 IPC may be retained and the punishment therein may be enhanced from "three months" to "one year" and the existing limit of imposing fine of Rs.200/= may be substitued by the words "Fine only".
(Para 12.90) Clause 201 - Under this clause, the existing Section 500 is sought to be substituted.
(Para 12.9 clause 204 - By virtue of this clause, a now: Section 507A is proposed to be inserted.
A gist of the comments received will be given in a later Chapter.
Section 22 confers the rule making power upon the Central Government to carry out the purposes of the Act while Section 23 empowers the Council to make regulations for the very same purpose.
Private Colleges (Regulation) Act and the Act, the Court observed: "27.
The provisions of the University Act regarding affiliation of technical Colleges like the engineering colleges and the conditions for grant and continuation of such affiliation by the University, shall, however, remain operative but the conditions that are prescribed by_the University for grant and continuance of affiliation will have to be in conformity with the norms and guidelines prescribed by the Council in respect of matters entrusted to it under Section 10 of the Central Act", ( Emphasis supplied) Unfortunately again, in this decision too, no proper focus was endowed upon the last words in clause (k) of Section 10, namely, "in consultation with the agencies concerned" nor upon the other matters relevant in construing Section 10 and clause (ki) therein.
It is arguable whether the Act contemplated such a serious and all-pervasive consequence and to say that had it intended to do so, it would have expressed its intention in clearer and emphatic language.
In other words, these Governments want the present clause (k) in Section 10 be deleted and in its place a new section on the lines of Section 10-A of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 be incorporated.
It has also suggested that the Council should create a monitoring body, preferably presided over by a retired High Court Judge, to keep an eye upon and to monitor the standards of education in the technical institutions in the country.
4,9 Ministry of Urban Affairs, Government of India has supported proposal (b) in the questionnaire.
4.10 Ministry of Industry (Industrial Development).
The Council shall dispose of the application according to law within four months of the receipt of the application provided the application complies with all the requirements of law.
The Council is also requiresi to regulate and ensure proper maintenance of normami Standards in the technical education system.
It inay not be necessary to notice the other provisions of the Act except Sections 22 and 23.
Without it, no technical institution can exist.
The provisions in Section 10A to 100 and the guidelines issued thereunder show that before permitting such establishment, the opinion and views of Indian Medical Council and the concerned university is also obtained.
Section 20 provides that every decree of nullity made by a District Judge shall be subject to confirmation by the High Court in the manner provided by section 17.
While a man seeking dissolution need prove only adultery on the part of his wife, a wife is required to prove some other marital offence in addition to adultery to be able to obtain dissolution.
2.8.2 In Mrs Neena v. John Pormere, a special bench of the three judges of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh observed as under: "... the procedure prescribed by section of, the Indian Divorce Act, requiring confirmation by the High Court of a decree for dissolution of a marriage made by District Judge, prolongs the agony of the affected parties even though none of the parties is desirous of preferring an appeal.
2.8.3 Similarly, a special Bench of three judges of the Calcutta High Court observed as follows in Swapna Ghosh V. Sadananda Ghosh and another : "I have, however, my own doubts as to whether the provisions of section 17 of the Indian Divorce Act requiring confirmation of the decree of the trial court by the High Court should any longer be retained.
(emphasis supplied) 2.10 The latest decision reiterating the above observations is that of the Kerala High Court.
A special Bench of three judges observed thus in their order dated 10th August 199812.
That too by a bench of three judges in courts where the number of judges is three or upwards and where the number of judges of the High Court is two, by a bench composed of two judges.
The judicial review and remedy are fundamental rights of the citizens.
1.5 The above decision is extremely significant and relevant for the purpose of this study and has accordingly been kept in mind while preparing this report.
They are also situated differently in the matter of their powers, status, importance, method of recruitment and other conditions of service.
Again, the emphasis placed by the committee upon the requirements of openness, fairness and impartiality has been reflected usually not in subsequent legislation, but by a change in general attitude by those tribunals which had not previously appreciated the full import of these characteristics.... the statutory instrument which governs the procedure of rent tribunals dates from 1946, though it has since been amended in some respects, and that instrument permits tribunals to sit either in private or in public at their own discretion.
Many of these are concerned with the detailed procedure of individual tribunals or types of inquiry, and need not be considered here.
TO that extent, the procedure for the selection of the members of the Tribunals, the manner in which funds are allocated for the functioning of the Tribunals and all other consequential details will have to be clearly spelt out."
The Law Commission has already stressed the need for imparting such training.
4.7 Measures to check deterioration in moral values.
Such a course will avoid the raising of any dispute on those issues as well as compel the presiding officer to adhere to the rule of law laid down by the superior court and avoid harassment to the litigants and confusion in the administration of law.
Ordinarily, right of review is available only to those who are party to a case.
The decision given by the Tribunal, unless reviewed or appealed against, attains finality.
The Law Commission has a feeling that the highly significant nature of the function performed by this Tribunal has not been duly and sufficiently appreciated by those concerned and it is probably for this reason that adquate number of Benches have not been created by the government which is absolutely essential for the prompt disposal of the large number of appeals filed before the Tribunal.
They must be provided with an official residence as soon as possible upon their appointment/posting to a particular city and they should also be entitled to all the perquisites and amenities admissible to their office.
The matters arising under the latter two enactments should, as far as possible, be given precedence in the matter of hearing.
Judicial review, by its very nature, content and concept, is only against administrative or quasi-judicial action of administrative and other authorities - say the critics.
Such a court on the lines of the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission created by the consumers Protection Act, 1986 would ensure that the power under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution is not invoked against the orders of the appellate forum.
(paragraph 4.13, supra) (k) cost for raising frivolous defences should be quantified by the tribunal and awarded to the opposite party as this will curb the tendency of filing frivolous cases.
(paragraph 4.16, supra) (n) There should be a reform of the administrative justice system in order to ensure better standards of independence, accessibility/openness, expertise, representativeness, efficiency and accoutability.
The appointment of the President of the Tribunal should be a direct appointment in the manner stated above, whereas section 129, as it stands now, contemplates appointing one of the Members of the Tribunal as the President thereof.
(paragraph 5.1.0, supra) (e) In every High Court there should at least be one Bench regularly hearing matters arising under the Income Tax Act, Central Excise and Salt Act and the Customs Act.
Therefore, justice demands that the recurring disputes on account of common questions of law should be finally settled at the earliest.
I am aware this will cause , you some inconvenience but the Commission will not be able to complete the in- depth study of the matter without your valued cu-operation.
The Tax Reforms Coinmittee set up by tie Covermell ulmeli Hats also recommended for the setting up of a Central Tax Court.

1W11.1 this not frustrate the object and purpose of the constitution of the Hotional Tribunal and cause delay?
At the end of the second part of whestion 3(1), we add: "Considering that two of the three qualifications referred to earlier are also qualifications which make a person eligible to be considered for appointment as a High Court Judge, in what way do you consider it possible to raise the status of the members consistent with the status to be prescribed for the President and/or Vice President."
(6C) Would you suggest any other powers to tille Selection Boerd in matters of administration oľ the Tribuns29?".
In such a situation, you may not repeat it.

This cardinal principle is the key to the National policy on Education'.
Primary schooling orrers the greatest economic and social returns, followed by secondary schooling.
Present scenarie of Education as source of development, 1.3 The observations of the World Bank point out the current position as regards primary education in the following words:- "India's primary education glass is two-thirds full, one-third empty.
In respect of children, nearly one-third of those under the age or 16 were engaged in child labour - many : in nazardous industries.
Under paragraph 5.10, it posed the q tion is to how the country will be prepared to deal ivith the links väster problem or child labour in other coupations as well the estimate or those so working värying rivim 50 million to number much higher.
The transformation did not occur without considerable public debate and while the upper and middle classes held this view of their own children they did not readily apply it to the children of the poor."
This attitude was closely linked to the idea of education of children.
In agrarian societies work by children is an integral part of the socialisation process and a means of transmitting traditionally acquired skills from parent to child.
Causes attributable to child labour Can be said to be poverty, low earning capacity of adults in Calvilies; unemployment; large families coupled with low incomo: Child labour as â cheap commodity; non-existence of provision for compulsory education; illiteracy and ignorance of parents about advantages of education, FOOT-NOTES AND REFERENCES CHAPTER-II Myron Weiner, The Child and the_State in India, Second Edr., Chapter 6, page 110.
Thereafter his right to education is and subject to the limits of economia capacity Havelopment of the State."
The Convention recognises the special vulnerability or children and deals not only witli civil and political rights biut also economic, social, cultural and humanitarian rights which are mutually inter-dependent.
The convention, is in a sense, a means of empowering children and creating an environment in which all children are able to live securely and realize their full potential to life.
The Right to participation: which includes respect for the views of the child, freedom of expression, access to appropriate information, and freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
The Convention provides the legal basis for initiating action to ensure the rights of children in society.
Other reforms to lower unit costs unit costs reduced by standardizing classes, thus increasing class size in many of the more privileg.
School resource allocation strictly on the basis of children enrolled, Number or topic in curriculum reduced.
This target, too was superseded when the 1986 National Policy on - Education articulated a goal of ensuring that by 1990 all cliildren 11 years or age would have completed five years of formal or non-formal education....
In keeping with this set up, the Central Plan outlay for education has been substantially increased from Rs.1,825 crore in 1995-96 to 15.3,383 crore ini 1996-97 and further to Rs.4,095 crore in 1997-78... 5.3.5.
Under the scheme, assistance is given to the states/union territories in the ratio or 60:40 and 90:10 for running general co-educational and girls centres respectively.
The guidelines should be finalised in consultation with State:'UT Governments.
However, the required outlay is of Rs.48,950 crore (comprising or Centre's share on Rs.30,000 crore and State and UT's share of Rs.
A copy of the same was forwarded to the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of Education, Government of India requesting for views of the Departient.
This proposal would enable tie maiden institutions to join the national endeavour to provide education to the children of India and to that extent will also help reduce the financial burden upon the State.
In fact, the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Human Resource Development has stated in paragraph 15.6 that the central Government should consider working out the necessary legislation to provide for the universalisation of free elementary education.
However, a specific provision enabling parent-teacher associations to monitor the functioning of the schools and the quality of education imparted therein would be in order.
It is essential that legislation should also contain a provision to ensure that good schools are established at reasonable distances so that quality education is available for all children.
The proposed article 21A reads as under: "21A.

All previous Acts dealing with the subject were repeated by section 127 of the said Act.
it would be appropriate to notice the relevant observations of the Supreme Court in paragraphs 44 and 45 of the said judgment :- "Reluctance of the apex court more concerned with civil law to interfere with the internal affairs of the Army is likely to create a distorted picture in the minds of the military personnel that persons subject to Army Act are not citizens of India.

The judge advocate or, if there is none, the presiding officer shall record or cause to be recorded such brief reasons in the proceedings.
Section 160 provides for revision of a finding or sentence recorded by the court-martial, it says" any finding or sentence of a court martial which requires confirmation may be once revised by order of the confirming authority and on such revisions, the Court if so directed by the confirming authority, may take additional evidence."
Section 164 provides for confirmation and the remedy for the persons against whom a finding or sentence of the court martial has been confirmed.
Even the provisions relating to judicial review by Judge-Advocate General in the Navy Act can also be deleted.
The Amendment should further provide for a statutory appeal to the Supreme Court against the final decisions and orders of such a Tribunal.
The Indian Parliament enacted the Hire Purchase Act, 1972 following the recommendations of the Law Commission.
lii) The Bill which seeks to amend comprehensively nearly half of the provisions of the Hire Purchase nieti, 1972, in some cases substituting the entire Provisions or the Act, has been brought forward pending enforcement of the Principal Act.
Ownership of the goods passes immediately the agreement is signed and the purchaser becomes an critimine y debtor for the several instalments of the purchase prices.
"Conditional sale agreement" means an agreement for clie sale or goods or land under which the purchase Birice or part of it is payable boy instalments, and the property in the goods or land is to remain in the seller notwithstanding that the buyer is to be in possession of the goods or land until such conditions as to the payment of instalments or otherwise as may be specified in the agreement are fu?filled".
A hire-purchase agreement thus creates a bailment, but is a bailment plus an option to purchase.
There is first an aspect of hailment of the goods subjected to the hire-purchase agreement, and there is next an element of sala which fructifies when the option to purchage, which is usually i tarm or hire-purchase agreements, is exercised by the intending purchaser.
When this sale takes place it will be liable to sales tax under the Act for the taxable event under the act is the taking place of the sale, the Act providing for a multi-point sales tax at the relevant time.
(2) In the other rorm of transactions, goods are purchased by the customer, who in consideration of executing a hire-purchase agreement and allied documents remains in possession of the goods, subject to liability to pay the amount paid by the financier on his behalf to the owner or dealer and the Financier obtains a hire purchase agreement which gives him a license to seize the goods in the event or failure by the customer to abide by the conditions of the hire-purchase agreement."
The question before the gurronins court was when does a sale liable to salat ja take place under a hire-purchase agreement.
Section 27 conferred upon the hirer/buyer the right to terminate the agreement any time before the final payment was made under the agreenient and the consequences flowing therefrom.
Thosy also provide the form in which applications are to be made to him.
It Inter alia, defines the expressions "conditional sale agreement', 'consumer credit agreement', 'consumer hire agreement', 'credit sale agreement', 'debtor-creditor-supplier agreement', 'hire purchase agreement', 'debtor', nirer', 'owner', 'creditor', 'protected goods', 'regulated agreements', 'restricted-use credit agreement', 'surety', 'supplier' and 'total price'.
A consumer credit agreement is called 'regulated agreement' within the meaning of the Act provided it does not fall under any of the exemptions provided by section 16.
An un-restricted-use credit agreement is a regulated consumer credit agreement not falling within the ambit of restricted-use credit agreement.
Sections 71, 72 and 73 also deal with the same subject-matter.
To the sanie effect is section 109 which casts a similar obligation upon the owner to furnish information to a surety under consumer hire agreement.
: In a subsequent communication dated 28th August 1998, the Federation brought to our notice that the aforesaid Annexure IX enclosed to their letter/representation dated 13th July 1998 was an Lincorrected one and was sent to the Law Commission by mistake.
The definition of the expression "owner" shall read as follows:- "(f) "owner" means the person who lets or has let, or the person who delivers or has delivered possession of goods, to a hirer under a hire-purchase agreement and includes a person to whom the owner's property in the goods or any of the rights or liabilities under the agreement has passed by assignment or by operation of law."
Section 3 as contained in the original Act and as proposed Lr les amended to 1989 (Amendment) Bill is wholly appropriate and needs no change.
One such set shall be handed over to the hirer and where tliere is a surety, yet another set to the surety, immediately after the execution of the Agreement."
The law Commission agrees with the said substitution as pointoit out in the.."questionnaire".
Ho olijrorition is also taken to the abilition of an illurinting arter Sub-section (2) of section 9 with a view to clearly explaining the formula contained in sub-section (2) of section 9.
It submitted, "It is likely that at a particular point of time a hirer, who is having three or four Hire Purchase Agreements with a Hire-Purchase Financier may have a large number of arrears in one or two Accounts, while the other accounts may be with only a smaller number of arrears.
2.21.1 The next suggestion of the Fedeation with respect to section 16 relates to sub-section (2) thereof.
The rights of the owner are amply protected by sub-section (2) of section 18 and it is unnecessary to add yet another right of termination by way of sub-section (2) of section 16.
He should return the goods-unless of course, he has disposed of the said goods befor the hirer makes the payment or remedies the breach as contempleted by this section.
This amendment is perfectly reasonable and should be accepted.
A consequential amendment is also suggested in sub-section (3).
It is obvious that the substitution suggested by the Federation is altogether a different proposition from the provision contained in section 28.
It was, however, made clear that the views, if any, expressed in the questionnaire by the Commission did not represent its final views but were only tentative opinions put forward with a view to eliciting effective and informed responses from members of the Bar, Bench and other persons concerned with the subject.
For a functioning democracy, court system, where justice is obtained even against the State, is a pre-requisite.
The road blocks in the access to justice could be high cost, geographical distance, adverse cost-benefit ratio and the inordinate delay in search of illusory justice.
114th 1.5.5 Besides, as the commission observed in its report on Gram Nayayalaya, Chapter V, para 5.3 that - "5.3 It would be unwise to look at the problem from the point of view of court management only.
For facility of comparison with the existing provisions of the Code which are sought to be modified by the Amendment Bill, an extract of such provisions is also appended to the Amendment Bill at internal pages 23 to 38 thereof.
Accordingly, several alternatives were suggested by the participants.
Such a move would only result in adding enormously to the burden of the Supreme Court because the only remedy, then available would be to approach the Supreme Court under article 136 of the constitution.
A few participants supported the proposal in its entirety.
In such a situation, abolition of second appeal altogether in all matters the value of subject-matter whereor does not exceed Rs.25,000/- may not be an appropriate step.
This rule may become inapplicable, if the proposed sub-ruie (3) is inserted.
In other words, all the amendments should be effected before the trial opened.
The Law Commission is of the opinion that this power of amendment of pleadings should not be taken away.
The proposal is to substitute Rule 9 in order VII.
Some of the learned trial judges suggested that once the suit was posted for trial and the court was in a position to take it up on that day, no adjournment whatsoever should be granted either at the request of one party or at the joint request of both the parties, unless of course it was a case of a death of a party or some other supervening reason which made the adjournment inevitable.
The fact, however, remains that not only is it a practice not sanctioned by the Code, it appears to run counter to the very discipline, dignity and decorum of the court.
(ii) In the light of the above discussion it must be said that the proposed amendment in sub-rule (2) is a welcome step and the Law Commission agrees with the same.
Be that as it may, we shall deal with the objections put forward to the new method suggested by the proposed Rule 4.

That is why we have made suitable recommendations in that behalf to bring our statutory law in con- formity with modern juristic principles.
That, in brief, is the approach adopted by the Commission in making its recommendations.
After the Commission was constituted in September 1971, it has forwarded to the Government Twenty-two Reports (Nos.
1.3.While many of the provisions of the Act of 1874 are not applicable to the majority of Indian women, a very important section--section 6-is so applicable.
In fact, the Constitution allows the State to make special provisions for woman.
Our object in making these recommendations is to provide and clarify statutorily that all married women in our country, wbatever be the religion they profess, are free to sue and be sued in respect of claims arising under contracts, torts or otherwise.
These disabilities of the wife were abolished by the enactment of section 4 of the Indian Succession Act, 1865,- later replaced by section 20 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925.
In pursuance of this doctrine, the Court of Chancery estab- lished that wherever property was given to trustees for the separate use of a mar- ried women, she could hold and dispose of it in Equits free from her husband's interference, and such property was protected effectual!« against the husband's debts and other obligations.
Eventually, it was decidei dat wherever the dener had expressed a plain intention that the property was for the separate use of the married woman, this should be effective, whether trustees had been appointed or not, the trust being, in the last resort, imposed on the husband himself.
It should be noted that it was not until the Legislature had accorded to a married woman financial independence from her husband that it was finally estab- lished that she had a similar right to her personal liberty.
These two pro- visions modify the common law rule to which we have referred.
It also enacted that "A married woman shall ............ be capable of acquiring, holding, and disposing by will or otherwise, of any real or personal property as her separate property, in the same manner as if she were a feme sole, without the intervention of any trustee."
Because of this position, the Legislature, in the Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act, 1935, abolished the concept of the separate estate, and gave to the wife the same rights and powers as were already possessed by other adults of full capacity.
Subsequently, by the Married Women's property Act, (1870), Amendment Act, 1874, this part of the Act of 1870 was replaced by a provision limiting the husband's liability for his wife's pre-marriage contracts to the extent of the value of the wife's property which vested in the husband by virtue of the marriage under the law as it then stood.
Act of 1882--pro- vision as to con- tracts 2.8A.The Married Women's Property Act, 1882, made certain important pro- visions regarding a married women's separate property, which have already been mentioned.
This was a retention of the principle of the English Act of 1874.
In the case of torts committed against a married woman, her legal personality was substantively recognized, and in so far as the tortious act caused injury to a legally recognized interest of the womán herself, it was a chose in action of the woman's, and if the hus- band predeceased the wife before having reduced her chose, it remained to the wife ; but, insofar as the injury was to the husband alone, either William Mccurdy.
Secondly, we would like to point out that the right of a woman to hold separate property of her own was recognised in the Hindu law, long before it was admitted in the European countries.
We propose to divide our historical survey of the position of women in India into the following divisions : (1) The period from c. 4000 B.C.
(5) The period from 1801 A.D. to 1955 A.D. (which may be conveniently called the British period).

In India, the deterioration in the position of women is perceptible in the Gupta age (320-540 A.D.).
In general, there was a decline in the social status of women.

The silence of Hiuen Tsang and I-tsing,' as to the seclusion of women, indicates that there was no such general practice, because such a peculiar custom would surely have been noticed by them.

Ultimately, by the Married Women's' (Restraints upon Anticipation) Act, 1949, all restraints, whenever imposed upon anticipa- tion, were removed."

It appears that in so far as these communities are concerned, because of their peculiar customs and habits, it may not be advisable to extend the whole or some part of the Act to them, and it will also appear that where exemption has not already been granted, it may be discovered later that if the operation of the Act in respect of these communities is not modified with retrospective effect, some hardship may arise.

Now, a trust can certainly be created in respect of the benefit of a contract.
By virtue of this section, what can be conveniently described as a "statutory trust" comes into being as we have already stated'.
"Para 8.44 to 8.46.
Mr. Ghose interprets them as meaning 'unconditionally, absolu- tely, or something of that kind.
To my mind, they mean nothing more than 'expressly expressed', the antithesis being to implied trust or a secret trust."
No trust was, therefore, held to have been created in favour of the wife.
In the circumstances, the Court held that even assuming that the statement in the proposal form could be said to be a statement expressed on the face of the policy,which it doubted --this statement was no sufficient to bring the policy within the ambit of section 6 of the Act, as it was vague.
In these circumstances, the Court held that the policy did not come within section 6(1).
We have considered the question whether any provision should be made to the effect that the intention to benefit the wife or children can be expressed in the proposal also.
In this case, it was held that a statutory trust in favour of the wife had been created.
This situation arose in a Bombay cases, and we may quote the facts and the point decided, from the judgement of the High Court.
It cannot be, he says, for the benefit only of the children without the wife".
The contention is that "any of them" has reference to any of the children along Emphasis added.

In execution of the decree, the appellant sought to attach a life policy taken by the debtor on his own life.
The Calculia High Court held that section 39, Insurance Act, conferred on the noraines the right to receive the insurance money as between such nomines and the Insurance Company, but it did not provide for the title of ownership of that idoney in general.
It was also held that th: terms of nomination in this case did not show that the policy was expressed on the face of it to be for the benefit of the wife within the meaning of section 6, Married Women's Property Act.
In these circumstances, section 6, Married Women's Property Act, can have no application."
The result of this discus: sion is that a nomination confers on the nonince Only a right to collect the amount, and confers no title.

The fiction of the unity of the husband and wife led to several rules, and one of the rules pertained to the field of liability of the husband for the wrongs committed by the wife.
Where a woman is a trustee, executrix or administratrix, either before or after marriage, her husband shall not, unless he acts or inter- meddles in the trust or administration, be liable for any breach of trust committed by her, or for any miapplication, loss or damage to the estate of the deceased caused or made by her, or for any loss to such estate arising from her neglect to get in any part of the property of the deceas- Section 10.
This change is consequential on our recommendation to expand the scope of section 6 of the Act of 1874 so as to authorise a trust for children.
